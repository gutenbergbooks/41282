<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/f.jpg" width="110" height="117" alt="F" /></span>OUR Englishmen are known to have
visited Angola towards the close of the
sixteenth century, namely, Thomas
Turner, Andrew Towres, Anthony
Knivet and Andrew Battell. All
four were taken by the Portuguese
out of English privateers in South-American waters, and
spent years of captivity as prisoners of war; happy, no
doubt, in having escaped the fate of many of their less
fortunate companions, who atoned with their lives for the
hazardous proceedings in which they had engaged.</p>

<p>Thomas Turner,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> although he furnished Samuel Purchas
with a few notes on Brazil, never placed on record what
happened to him whilst in Portuguese Africa. Towres was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
sent to prison at Rio de Janeiro for the heinous offence of
eating meat on a Friday; he attempted an escape, was
retaken, and condemned to spend the rest of his captivity
in Angola. He died at Masanganu, as we learn from
Knivet. Knivet himself has left us an account of his
adventures in Angola and Kongo; but this account contains
so many incredible statements that it was with some
hesitation we admitted it into this volume, as by doing so
we might be supposed to vouch for the writer&#8217;s veracity.</p>

<p>Andrew Battell, fortunately, has left behind him a fairly
circumstantial record of what he experienced in Kongo
and Angola. His narrative bears the stamp of truth, and
has stood the test of time. It is unique, moreover, as being
the earliest record of travels in the <i>interior</i> of this part of
Africa; for, apart from a few letters of Jesuit missionaries,
the references to Kongo or Angola printed up to Battell&#8217;s
time, were either confined to the coast, or they were purely
historical or descriptive. Neither F. Pigafetta&#8217;s famous
<i>Relatione del Reame di Congo</i>, &#8220;drawn out of the writings
and discourses of Duarte Lopez,&#8221; and first published at
Rome in 1591, nor the almost equally famous <i>Itinerarium</i>
of Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, of which an English
translation appeared as early as 1598, can be classed
among books of travel.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Samuel Braun, of Basel, who
served as barber-surgeon on board Dutch vessels which
traded at Luangu and on the Kongo, 1611-13, never left the
coast.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Nor did Pieter van der Broeck, who made three
voyages to the Kongo between 1607 and 1612 as supercargo
of Dutch vessels, penetrate inland.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Nay, we are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
even able to claim on behalf of Battell that he travelled
by routes not since trodden by European explorers.</p>

<p class="tb">Of Andrew Battell&#8217;s history we know nothing, except
what may be gathered from his &#8220;Adventures,&#8221; and an
occasional reference to him by his friend, neighbour, and
editor, the Rev. Samuel Purchas. He seems to have been a
native of Leigh, in Essex, at the present day a mere fishing
village by the side of its populous upstart neighbour
Southend, but formerly a place of considerable importance.
As early as the fifteenth century it could boast of its guild
of pilots, working in harmony with a similar guild at Deptford
Strond, the men of Leigh taking charge of inward
bound ships, whilst Deptford provided pilots to the outward
bound. Henry VIII incorporated both guilds as the
&#8220;Fraternity of the Most Glorious and Indivisible Trinity
and of St. Clement;&#8221; and in the venerable church of
St. Clement, at Leigh, and the surrounding churchyard
may still be seen monuments erected in honour of contemporaries
of Battell who were Brethren of the Trinity
House; among whom are Robert Salmon (born 1567, died
1661) and Robert Chester (died 1632). But there is no
tombstone in memory of Andrew Battell; and if a memorial
tablet was ever dedicated to him, it must have been removed
when the church was renovated in 1837. Nor do the
registers of the church afford a clue to Battell&#8217;s death, for
the earliest of these documents only dates back to the year
1684. At the present time no person of the name of
Battell lives at Leigh.</p>

<p class="tb">Samuel Purchas was Vicar of Eastwood, a small village
two miles to the north of Leigh, from 1604 to 1613.
Battell returned to Leigh about 1610, bringing with
him a little negro boy, who claimed to have been kept a
captive by a gorilla (see p. 55). Purchas had many conferences
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
with Battell, and the information obtained in this
manner was incorporated by him in <i>Purchas His Pilgrimage</i>,
the first edition of which was published in 1613,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and will
be found in this volume, pp. 71-87. Battell&#8217;s papers,
however, only reached Purchas after the author&#8217;s death,
and were first published by him in <i>Hakluytus Posthumus,
or Purchas His Pilgrimes</i>, in 1625.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> There is reason to
fear that Purchas did not perform his duties as editor, as
such duties are understood at the present day. As an
instance, we notice that Battell distinctly told his editor in
private conference (see p. 83) that in his day nothing was
known about the origin of the Jagas, expressly denying
that Duarte Lopez could have any information about it;
yet, elsewhere (p. 19), Battell is made responsible for the
statement that they came from Sierra Leone. Nor is it
likely that Battell ever mentioned a lake Aquelunda
(p. 74), for no such lake exists; and Purchas&#8217;s authority
for its supposed existence is once more Duarte Lopez or
Pigafetta.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is some ground for supposing that
Purchas abridged portions of the MS.; as, for instance,
the account of the overland trading trip to Kongo and
Mbata. Perhaps he likewise rearranged parts of his MS.,
thus confusing the sequence of events, as will be seen when
we come to inquire into the chronology of Battell&#8217;s travels.</p>

<p class="tb">There exists no doubt as to the object with which Abraham
Cocke sailed for the Plate River in 1589. Philip of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
Spain had acceded to the throne of Portugal in 1580, and
that prosperous little kingdom thus became involved in
the disaster which overtook the Armada, which sailed out
of Lisbon in May, 1588. English skippers therefore felt
justified in preying upon Portuguese trade in Brazil, and
intercepting Spanish vessels on their way home from the
Rio de la Plata. We do not think, however, that we do
Abraham Cocke an injustice when we assume him to have
been influenced in his hazardous enterprise quite as much
by the lust of gain as by patriotism.</p>

<p>The determination of the chronology of Battell&#8217;s adventures
presents some difficulty, as his narrative contains but a
single date, namely, that of his departure from England on
May 7th, 1589. There are, however, incidental references
to events the dates of which are known; and these enable
us to trace his movements with a fair amount of confidence,
thus:&#8212;</p>

<p>
1. Having left Plymouth in May, 1589, we suppose
Battell to have reached Luandu in June, 1590.
</p><p>
2. His journey up to Masanganu, his detention there for
two months, and return to Luandu, where he &#8220;lay eight
months in a poor estate&#8221; (p. 7), would carry us to the end
of June, 1591.</p><p>
3. Battell tells us that the Governor, D. Jo&atilde;o Furtado
de Mendon&ccedil;a, then employed him during two years and
a half trading along the coast. This, however, is quite
impossible: for Mendon&ccedil;a only assumed office in August,
1594; but, as he is the only Governor of Battell&#8217;s day who
held office for a longer period than two and a half years&#8212;his
term of office extending to 1602&#8212;and as Battell is
not likely to have forgotten the name of an employer who
gave him his confidence, we assume that he really did
make these trading trips, but at a subsequent period.
Purchas may be responsible for this transposition.</p>

<p>4. He made a first attempt to escape (in a Dutch vessel),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
but was recaptured, and sent to Masanganu, where he
spent &#8220;six miserable years,&#8221; 1591-96.
</p><p>
5. Second attempt to escape, and detention for three
months in irons at Luandu, up to June, 1596.
</p><p>
6. Campaign in Lamba and Ngazi (see p. 13, <i>note</i>).
After a field service of over three years, Battell was sent
back to Luandu, wounded. This would account for his time
up to 1598 or 1599.
</p><p>
7. I am inclined to believe that, owing to the confidence
inspired by his conduct in the field, the Governor now
employed him on the trading ships referred to above.
</p><p>
9. Trading trips to Benguella in 1600 or 1601.
</p><p>
10. Battell joins the Jagas, and spends twenty-one
months with them. Incidentally he mentions that the
chief, Kafuche, had been defeated by the Portuguese seven
years before that time (he was actually defeated in April,
1594).
</p><p>
11. Battell was at Masanganu when Jo&atilde;o Rodrigues
Coutinho was Governor (Coutinho assumed office in
1602).
</p><p>
12. Battell was present at the building of the presidio
of Kambambe by Manuel Cerveira Pereira in 1604;
and stayed there till 1606, when news was received
of the death of Queen Elizabeth, and he was promised
his liberty. The Queen died March 24th, 1603.
</p><p>
13. A journey to Mbamba, Kongo, etc., may have taken
up six months.

14. The Governor having &#8220;denied his word,&#8221; and a
new Governor being daily expected, Battell secretly left
the city, spent six months on the Dande, and was ultimately
landed at Luangu. (The new Governor expected
was only appointed in August, 1607; and his arrival was
actually delayed.)
</p><p>
15. In Luangu, Battell spent two years and a half&#8212;say
up to 1610.</p>

<p>Great pains have been taken by me with the maps illustrating
this volume; and, if the outcome of my endeavour
does not differ in its broad features from the maps furnished
by M. d&#8217;Anville, in 1732, to Labat&#8217;s <i>Relation Historique de
l&#8217;&Eacute;thiopie Occidentale</i>, this should redound to the credit of
the great French geographer, but should not be accounted
a proof of lack of industry on my own part. Still, my
maps exhibit an advance in matters of detail, for our
knowledge of the country has increased considerably since
the days of d&#8217;Anville. They would have proved still more
satisfactory had the Portuguese thought it worth while to
produce a trustworthy map of a colony of which they had
claimed possession during four centuries. It seems almost
incredible that even now many of the routes followed by
the Conquistadores and missionaries of old cannot be laid
down upon a modern map for lack of information. Sonyo,
for instance, through which led the high road followed by
soldiers, traders, and missionaries going up to San Salvador
(the present route leaves the Kongo River at Matadi), is
almost a <i>terra incognita</i>. I am almost ashamed to confess
that I have even failed to locate the once-famous factory of
Mpinda; all I can say is, that it cannot have occupied the
site assigned to it on some Portuguese maps.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that modern research lends no support
to the extravagant claims of certain geographers as to the
knowledge of Inner Africa possessed by the Portuguese in
the sixteenth century. Pigafetta&#8217;s fantastic map, with its
elaborate system of lakes and rivers, merely proves the
utter incapacity of its author to deal with questions of
critical geography. This has long since been recognised.
The map which accompanies Isaac Vossius&#8217;s <i>De Nili et
aliorum Fluminum Origine</i> (Hagae Com., 1659) only
shows one lake in Inner Africa, which borders on
&#8220;Nimeamaie vel Monemugi,&#8221; and may without hesitation
be identified with our Nyasa: for the Monemugi (Muene
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
Muji) is the chief of the Maravi or Zimbas. The &#8220;Iages, gens
barbara et inculta,&#8221; are placed right in the centre of Africa.
The &#8220;Fungeni,&#8221; which are shown as neighbours of the
&#8220;Macoco,&#8221; ought to have been placed to the west of Abyssinia,
as they are the Funj, or Fung, of the Egyptian
Sudan. If Ludolfus had carried out his intention of compiling
a map of the whole of Africa (in 1681), these
extravagancies of early map-makers would have been
exposed more fully long since.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p class="tb">In collecting materials for the maps and for the notes
illustrating Battell&#8217;s narrative, I felt bound to consult all
accessible literary sources dealing with the history and
geography of Kongo and Angola. Whilst ploughing my
way through this mass of material, it struck me that a concise
history of these African countries, from the time of
their discovery to the end of the seventeenth century, might
form an acceptable appendix to Battell&#8217;s <i>Adventures</i>, and
at the same time increase the bulk of the volume dedicated
to him to more respectable proportions. Much material of
use for such a purpose has seen the light since the publication
of J. J. Lopes de Lima&#8217;s historical sketches. Yet I am
bound to confess that the result of all this tedious labour is
disappointing. I may have been able to rectify a few dates
and facts; but much remains to be done before we can
claim to be in possession of a trustworthy history of that
part of Africa. Possibly my little sketch may rouse a
Portuguese into taking up the work of the late Luciano
Cordeiro. Many documents not yet published should be
discoverable in the archives of Portugal, Spain, and Luandu.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span></p>

<p>The spelling of the proper names mentioned by Battell
is retained, as a matter of course; but it is obvious that in
the historical appendices the various ways in which native
names are spelt had to be reduced to a common system.
Much might be said in favour of accepting the Portuguese
manner of spelling, but after due consideration I decided
to adopt the system now generally followed (even by a few
Portuguese writers), viz., that all vowels should be sounded
as in Italian, and the consonants as in English, with the
only exception that the letter <i>g</i> should always be hard.
I therefore write Sonyo, instead of Sonho, Sogno, or Sonjo,
as the name of that district is spelt according to the
nationality of the writer. In transcribing the native names
I have had the unstinted assistance, among others, of the
Rev. Thomas Lewis, of the Baptist Missionary Society; yet
I am fully aware that the spelling adopted for many names
is at least doubtful, if not absolutely incorrect. This arises
quite as much from a defective hearing on the part of my
authorities, as from the illegibility of many early manuscripts
or the carelessness of copyists. All such doubtful
cases are dealt with in the <span class="smcap">Glossary</span> and <span class="smcap">Index</span>.</p>

<p class="tb">In conclusion, I feel bound to acknowledge with gratitude
the kindly assistance rendered me by Mr. R. E. Dennett,
who is spending a life-time in Luangu; Mr. R. C. Phillips,
who is thoroughly acquainted with the Lower Kongo; the
Rev. Thomas Lewis, of the Baptist Missionary Society;
Captain Binger, of the French Foreign Office; and last, not
least, our ever-obliging Secretary, Mr. William Foster.</p>

<p class="indent2">Cavazzi, a Capuchin, visited Kongo and Angola twice (1654-67, 1670-??)

Bologna. Labat (&#8220;Relation historique de l&#8217;&Eacute;thiopie,&#8221; Paris, 1732)
has given a useful version of it in French, which must, however, be
used with some caution. It is by far the most important work
we have at the hand of one of the early Catholic missionaries.
W. D. Cooley&#8217;s observation (&#8220;Inner Africa Laid Open,&#8221; London,
1852, p. 3), that the works published up to the time of Cavazzi
&#8220;would hardly furnish twenty pages of sound geographical intelligence,&#8221;
can apply only to what they say of Inner Africa; whilst
Lopez de Lima (&#8220;Ensaios,&#8221; p. xi) is hardly justified in calling
Cavazzi a &#8220;fabulista,&#8221; unless that opprobrious term be confined to

<h4>&sect; I.</h4>

<h4><i>Andrew Battel, his Voyage to the River of Plate, who being
taken on the coast of Brasill, was sent to Angola.</i></h4>

<h4>[<i>From the Thames to Cape Palmas.</i>]</h4>

<p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/i.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="I" /></span>N the year 1589, Abraham Cocke<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> of
Limehouse, began his voyage toward
the River of Plate, with two pinnaces<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
of fifty tons apiece: the one was called
the <i>May-Morning</i>, the other the <i>Dolphin</i>.</p>

<p>We sailed from the river Thames the twentieth of April;
and the six and twentieth of the same month we put into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Plimmoth [Plymouth], where we took in some provision
for the voyage. The seventh of May we put to sea, and
with foul weather were beaten back again into Plimmoth,
where we remained certain days, and then proceded on our
voyage: And running along the coast of Spain and Barbary
we put into the road of Sancta Cruz,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and there set
our Light-horse-man<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> together which we carried in two
pieces. Abraham Cocke made great account hereof, thinking
that this boat should have made his voyage. This
done, we put to sea, and running along the coast of Guinea
we were becalmed, because we were so near the coast.</p>

<h4>[<i>St. Thom&eacute; and the Gulf of Guinea.</i>]</h4>

<p>Here our men fell sick of the scurvy, in such sort, that
there were very few sound. And being within three or
four degrees of the equinoctial line we fell with the Cape
de las Palmas, where we had some refreshing, wherewith
our men recovered. The people of the Cape de las Palmas
[Cabo das Palmas] made much of us, saying that they
would trade with us; but it was but to betray us, for they
are very treacherous, and were like to have taken our boat,
and hurt some of our men. From this Cape we lay south-west
off;<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> but the current and the calms deceived us, so
that we were driven down to the isle of St. Thom&eacute;,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> thinking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
that we had been further off to the Sea than we were.
And being in distress for wood and water, we went in on
the south end between San Tome and the islands das
Rolas,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> where we rode very smooth, and with our light-horse-man
went on shore, thinking to have watered, but we
found none in the island. Here we had great store of
plantains and oranges. We found a village of negroes,
which are sent from San Tome, for the Portugals of San
Tome do use, when their slaves be sick or weak, to send
them thither to get their strength again. For the islands
are very fruitful, and though there be no fresh water,
yet they maintain themselves with the wine of the
palm-trees. Having refreshed ourselves with the fruit of
this island, we burned the village. And running on the
east side of San Tome we came before the town;<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> but we
durst not come near, for the castle shot at us, which hath
very good ordnance in it.</p>

<p>Then we lay east and by south toward the main, and in
four and twenty hours we had sight of the Cape de Lopo
Gonsalves:<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and being within three leagues of the said cape
we cast about and stood again toward the island of San
Tome, and turned up on the west side of the island; and
coming to a little river, which runneth out of the mountains,
we went on shore with our Light-horse-man, with six
or seven butts to fill with water. But the governor had
ambushed one hundred men of the island; and when we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
were on shore they came upon us, and killed one of our
men and hurt another: wherefore we retired to our boat
and got aboard.</p>

<h4>[<i>Across the Atlantic to the Brazils.</i>]</h4>

<p>Then Abraham Cocke determined to fetch the coast of
Brasil, and lay west-south-west into the sea: and being
some fifty leagues off, we fell into a shoal of dolphins,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
which did greatly relieve us, for they did follow our ship all
the way, till we fell [in] with the land, which was some
thirty days. And running along the coast of Brasil till we
came to Ilha Grande,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> which standeth in five [<i>sic</i>] degrees
southward of the line, we put in betwixt the island and the
main, and haled our ships on shore, and washed them, and
refreshed ourselves, and took in fresh water. In this island
are no inhabitants, but it is very fruitful. And being here
some twelve days there came in a little pinnace which was
bound to the River of Plate, which came in to water and
to get some refreshments: and presently we went aboard,
and took the Portugal merchant out of the pinnace, which
told Abraham Cocke, that within two months there should
two pinnaces come from the River of Plate, from the town
of Buenos Aires.</p>

<h4>[<i>The Rio de la Plata.</i>]</h4>

<p>From this town there come every year four or five
caravels to Bahia<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> in Brasil, and to Angola in Africa, which
bring great store of treasure, which is transported overland
out of Peru into the River of Plate. There Abraham
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Cocke, desirous to make his voyage, took some of the
<i>Dolphin&#8217;s</i> men into his ship, and sent the <i>Dolphin</i> home
again, which had not as yet made any voyage. This
Portugal merchant carried us to a place in this island,
where there was a banished man,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> which had planted great
store of plantains, and told us that we might, with this fruit,
go to the River of Plate: for our bread and our victuals
were almost all spent.</p>

<p>With this hard allowance we departed from this island,
and were six-and-thirty days before we came to the Isle of
Lobos Marinos,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> which is in the mouth of the River of
Plate. This island is half a mile long, and hath no fresh
water, but doth abound with seals and sea-morses,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> in such
sort that our light-horseman could not get on shore for
them, without we did beat them with our oars: and the
island is covered with them. Upon these seals we lived
some thirty days, lying up and down in the river, and were
in great distress of victuals. Then we determined to run
up to Buenos Aires, and with our light-horseman to take
one of the pinnaces that rid at the town. And, being so
high up the river as the town, we had a mighty storm at
south-west,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> which drove us back again, and we were fain
to ride under the Isla Verde<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>&#8212;that is, the green island&#8212;which
is in the mouth of the river on the north side.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<h4>[<i>A Prisoner of the Portuguese.</i>]</h4>

<p>Here we were all discomforted for lack of victuals and
gave over the voyage, and came to the northward again,
to the isle of Sant Sebastian, lying just under the tropic
of Capricorn.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> There we went on shore to catch fish, and
some went up into the woods to gather fruit, for we were
all in a manner famished. There was at that time a canoe
fraught with Indians, that came from the town of Spiritu
Sancto.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> These Indians landed on the west side of the
island, and came through the woods and took five of us,
and carried us to the River of Janeiro [Rio de Janeiro].
After this mischance our captain, Abraham Cocke, went
to sea, and was never heard of more.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<h4>[<i>Transported to Angola&#8212;A Voyage to the Zaire.</i>]</h4>

<p>When we that were taken had remained four months
in the River of Janeiro, I and one Torner<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> were sent to
Angola in Africa, to the city of Saint Paul,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> which standeth
in nine degrees to the southward of the equinoctial line.
Here I was presently taken out of the ship and put into
prison, and sent up the River Quansa,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> to a town of
garrison, which is 130 miles up the river. And being
there two months the pilot of the governor&#8217;s pinnace died:
then I was commanded to carry her down to the city,
where I presently fell sick, and lay eight months in a poor
estate, for they hated me because I was an Englishman.
But being recovered of my sickness, Don John Hurtado de
Mendo&ccedil;a,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> who then was governor, commanded me to go
to the river of Congo, called Zaire, in a pinnace, to trade
for elephants&#8217; teeth,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> wheat,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> and oil of the palm-tree.
The river Zaire<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> is fifty leagues from the city, to the northward,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and is the greatest river in all that coast. In the
mouth of that river is an island, called the Isle de Calabes,
which had at that time a town in it. Here we laded our
pinnace with elephants&#8217; teeth, wheat, and oil of the palm,
and so returned to the city again.</p>

<h4>&sect; II.</h4>

<p class="indent3"><i>His trading on the coast; offer to escape; imprisonment;
exile; escape and new imprisonment; his sending to
Elamba and Bahia das Vaccas; many strange occurrences.</i></p>

<h4>[<i>Trading in Loango.</i>]</h4>

<p>When I was sent to Longo [Loango], which is fifteen
leagues to the northward of the River Zaire, and carried all
commodities fit for that country, as long glass beads, and
round blue beads, and seed beads, and looking-glasses, blue
and red coarse cloth, and Irish rugs, which were very rich
commodities. Here we sold our cloth at a great rate, for
we had for one yard of cloth three elephants&#8217; teeth, that
weighed 120 pounds; and we bought great store of palm-cloth<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
and elephants&#8217; tails.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> So, in little time we laded
our pinnace. For this voyage I was very welcome to the
governor, who promised me my liberty if I would serve
him. So I went in his pinnace two years and a half upon
the coast.</p>

<h4>[<i>An Attempted Escape.</i>]</h4>

<p>Then there came a ship of Holland to the city, the
merchant of which ship promised to carry me away. And,
when they were ready to depart I went secretly on board,
but I was betrayed by Portugals which sailed in the ship,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and was fetched on shore by sergeants of the city and put
in prison, and lay with great bolts of iron two months,
thinking that the governor would have put me to death.
But at last I was banished for ever to the Fort of
Massangano, to serve in the conquest of those parts.
Here I lived a most miserable life for the space of six years
without any hope to see the sea again.</p>

<h4>[<i>A Second Attempt at Escape.</i>]</h4>

<p>In this fort there were Egyptians and Moriscoes that were
banished as myself. To one of these Egyptians<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> I brake
my mind, and told him that it were better for us to venture
our lives for our liberty than to live in that miserable place.
This Egyptian was as willing as myself, and told me he
would procure ten of his consorts to go with us. So we got
three Egyptians and seven Portugals. That night we got
the best canoe that we could find, and went down the river
Cuanza, and being as far down as Mani Cabech,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> which is
a little lord in the province of Elamba [Lamba], we went
on shore with our twelve muskets, powder and shot.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Here we sunk our canoe, because they should not know
where we went on shore. We made a little fire in the
wood, and scorched Guinea wheat,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> which we [had]
brought from Massangano, to relieve us, for we had none
other food.</p>

<p>As soon as it was night, we took our journey all that
night and the next day, without any water at all. The
second night we were not able to go, and were fain to dig
and scrape up roots of trees, and suck them to maintain
life. The third day we met with an old negro which was
travelling to Mani Cabech. We bound his hands behind
him, and made him lead us the way to the Lake of
Casansa.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> And, travelling all that day in this extreme
hot country we came to the Bansa [mbanza], or town, of
Mani Casansa, which lyeth within the land twelve leagues
from the city of San Paulo. Here we were forced to ask
water, but they would give us none. Then we determined
to make them flee their houses with our shot; but seeing
that we were desperately bent they called their Lord, Mani
Casansa, who gave us water and fair speeches, desiring us
to stay all night, only to betray us; but we departed presently,
and rested that night in (<i>sic</i>) the lake of Casansa.</p>

<p>The fourth day, at night, we came to the river which is
towards the north,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> and passed it with great danger. For
there are such abundance of crocodiles in this river that no
man dare come near the riverside when it is deep. The
fifth day, at night, we came to the river Dande, and
travelled so far to the eastward that we were right against
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the Serras, or mountains of Manibangono,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> which is a lord
that warreth against the King of Congo, whither we intended
to go. Here we passed the river, and rested half
the night. And being two leagues from the river we met
with negroes, which asked us whither we travelled. We
told them that we were going to Congo. These negroes
said that we were in the wrong way, and that they were
Masicongos,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> and would carry us to Bambe,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> where the
Duke of Bambe lay.</p>

<p>So we went some three miles east, up into the land, till we
perceived that we were in the wrong way, for we travelled
by the sun, and would go no further that way, and turned
back again to the westward; they stood before us with their
bows, arrows and darts, ready to shoot at us. But we,
determining to go through them, discharged six muskets
together and killed four, which did amaze them, and made
them to retire. But they followed us four or five miles, and
hurt two of our company with their arrows. The next day
we came within the borders of Bamba, and travelled all that
day. At night we heard the surge of the sea. The seventh
day, in the morning, we saw the captain of the city come
after us with horsemen and great store of negroes. Hereupon
our company being dismayed, seven of our faint-hearted
Portugals hid themselves in the thickets. I, and
the four Egyptians, thought to have escaped, but they
followed us so fast that we were fain to go into a little
wood. As soon as the captain had overtaken us he discharged
a volley of shot into the wood, which made us lose
one another.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<h4>[<i>Surrenders to a Portuguese Captain.</i>]</h4>

<p>Thus, being all alone, I bethought myself that if the
negroes did take me in the woods they would kill me:
wherefore, thinking to make a better end among the
Portugals and Mulatoes, I came presently out of the wood
with my musket ready charged, making none account of
my life. But the captain, thinking that we had been all
twelve together, called to me and said: &#8220;Fellow Soldier, I
have the governor&#8217;s pardon; if you will yield yourselves
you shall have no hurt.&#8221; I, having my musket ready,
answered the captain that I was an Englishman, and had
served six years at Massangono, in great misery; and came
in company with eleven Portugals and Egyptians, and here
am left all alone; and rather than I will be hanged, I will
die amongst you. Then the captain came near unto me
and said: &#8220;Deliver thy musket to one of the soldiers; and I
protest, as I am a gentleman and a soldier, to save thy life
for thy resolute mind.&#8221; Whereupon I yielded up my
musket and myself.</p>

<p>Then the captain commanded all the soldiers and
negroes to search the woods, and to bring them out alive
or dead, which was presently done. Then they carried us
to the city of San Paulo, where I and the three Egyptians
lay in prison three months with collars of iron, and great
bolts upon our legs, and hardly escaped.</p>

<h4>[<i>A campaign in Lamba.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></h4>

<p>At that time the governor sent four hundred men, that
were banished out of Portugal, up into the country of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Elambe. Then I was with proclamation through the city
banished for ever to the wars, and marched with them to
Sowonso,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> which is a lord that obeyeth the Duke of Bamba;
from thence to Samanibansa, and then to Namba Calamba,
which is a great lord, who did resist us. But we burnt his
town, and then he obeyed us, and brought three thousand
warlike negroes to us. From thence [we marched] to
Sollancango, a little lord, that fought very desperately
with us, but was forced to obey; and then to Combrecaianga,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>
where we remained two years. From this place we
gave many assaults and brought many lords to subjection.
We were fifteen thousand strong, and marched to the
Outeiro,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> or mountain, of Ingombe. But first we burnt
all Ingasia, which was his country, and then we came to
the chief town of Ingombe, which is half a day&#8217;s journey
to go up.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>This lord came upon us with more than twenty thousand
bows, and spoilt many of our men. But with our shot we
made a great spoil among them, whereupon he retired up
into the mountain, and sent one of his captains to our
general, signifying that the next day he would obey him.
The next day he entered our camp with great pomp, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
drums, petes,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> and Pongoes,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> or waits, and was royally
received; and he gave great presents, and greatly enriched
the general, and them which marched up. Upon the top
of the mountain is a great plain, where he hath his chief
town; very fresh, full of palm-trees, sugar-canes, potatoes,
and other roots, and great store of oranges and lemons.
Here is a tree that is called <i>Engeriay</i>,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> that beareth a fruit
as big as a pome-water,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> and hath a stone in it, present
remedy (<i>sic</i>) for the wind colic, which was strange to the
Portugals. Here is a river of fresh water, that springeth
out of the mountains and runneth all along the town. We
were here five days, and then we marched up into the
country, and burned and spoiled for the space of six weeks,
and then returned to Engombe again, with great store of
margarite stones,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> which are current money in that land.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Here we pitched our camp a league from this pleasant
mountain, which remained twelve months: but I was shot
in my right leg, and many Portugals and Mulatoes were
carried to the city to be cured.</p>

<h4>[<i>A Voyage to Benguella.</i>]</h4>

<p>Then the governor sent a fregatte to the southward, with
sixty soldiers, myself being one of the company, and all
kinds of commodities. We turned up to the southward
until we came into twelve degrees. Here we found a fair
sandy bay. The people of this place brought us cows and
sheep, wheat<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> and beans; but we staid not there, but came
to Bahia das Vaccas: that is, the Bay of Cows, which the
Portugals call Bahia de Torre,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> because it hath a rock like
a tower. Here we rode on the north side of the rock, in a
sandy bay, and bought great store of cows, and sheep&#8212;bigger
than our English sheep&#8212;and very fine copper.
Also, we bought a kind of sweet wood, called <i>Cacongo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
which the Portugals esteem much, and great store of wheat
and beans. And having laded our bark we sent her home;
but fifty of us staid on shore, and made a little fort with
rafters of wood, because the people of this place are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
treacherous, and not to be trusted. So, in seventeen days
we had five hundred head of cattle; and within ten days
the governor sent three ships, and so we departed to the
city.</p>

<p>In this bay may any ship ride without danger, for it is a
smooth coast. Here may any ship that cometh out of the
East Indies refresh themselves. For the Portugals carracks<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
now of late come along the coast, to the city, to water and
refresh themselves. These people are called <i>Endalanbondos</i>,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
and have no government among themselves, and
therefore they are very treacherous, and those that trade
with these people must stand upon their own guard. They
are very simple, and of no courage, for thirty or forty men
may go boldly into the country and fetch down whole herds
of cattle. We bought the cattle for blue glass beads of an
inch long, which are called <i>Mopindes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> and paid fifteen beads
for one cow.</p>

<p>This province is called Dombe,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> and it hath a ridge of
high <i>serras</i>, or mountains, that stretch from the <i>serras</i> or
mountains of Cambambe, wherein are mines, and lie along
the coast south and by west. Here is great store of fine
copper, if they would work in their mines; but they take
no more than they wear for a bravery. The men of this
place wear skins about their middles and beads about their
necks. They carry darts of iron, and bow and arrows in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
their hands. They are beastly in their living, for they have
men in women&#8217;s apparel, whom they keep among their
wives.</p>

<p>Their women wear a ring of copper about their necks,
which weigheth fifteen pound at the least; about their arms
little rings of copper, that reach to their elbows; about
their middle a cloth of the <i>Insandie</i> tree, which is neither
spun nor woven;<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> on their legs rings of copper that reach
to the calves of their legs.</p>

<h4>[<i>A Second Voyage to Benguella.</i>]</h4>

<p>In our second voyage, turning up along the coast, we
came to the Morro, or cliff of Benguelle,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> which standeth in
twelve degrees of southerly latitude. Here we saw a
mighty camp on the south side of the river Cova.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> And
being desirous to know what they were, we went on shore
with our boat; and presently there came a troop of five
hundred men to the waterside. We asked them who they
were. Then they told us that they were the Gagas, or
Gindes, that came from Sierra de lion [Serra Le&ocirc;a],<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
passed through the city of Congo, and so travelled to the
eastward of the great city of Angola, which is called
Dongo.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> The great Gaga, which is their general, came
down to the waterside to see us, for he had never seen
white men before. He asked wherefore we came. We told
him that we came to trade upon the coast. Then he bade
us welcome, and called us on shore with our commodities.
We laded our ship with slaves in seven days, and bought
them so cheap that many did not cost one real, which were
worth in the city [of Loanda] twelve milreis.</p>

<p>[In a marginal note, Purchas adds:&#8212;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;He, in discourse with me, called them Iagges, and their chief
the great Iagge. I think he writ them Gagas for Giagas, by false
spelling.&#8221;]</p>

<h4>[<i>Among the Jagas.</i>]</h4>

<p>Being ready to depart, the great Giaga staid us, and
desired our boat to pass his men over the river Cova, for
he determined to overrun the realm of Benguele, which
was on the north side of the river Cova. So we went with
him to his camp, which was very orderly, entrenched with
piles of wood; we had houses provided for us that night,
and many burthens [loads] of palm-wine, cows, goats and
flour.</p>

<p>In the morning, before day, the general did strike his
<i>gongo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> which is an instrument of war that soundeth like
a bell, and presently made an oration with a loud voice,
that all the camp might hear, that he would destroy the
Benguelas, with such courageous and vehement speeches
as were not to be looked for among the heathen people.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
And presently they were all in arms, and marched to the
river side, where he had provided <i>Gingados</i>.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> And being
ready with our boat and <i>Gingados</i>, the general was fain to
beat them back because of the credit who should be first.
We carried over eighty men at once, and with our muskets
we beat the enemy off, and landed, but many of them were
slain. By twelve of the clock all the Gagas were over.</p>

<p>Then the general commanded all his drums, <i>tavales</i>,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>
<i>petes</i>, <i>pongos</i>, and all his instruments of warlike music to
strike up, and gave the onset, which was a bloody day for
the Benguelas. These Benguelas presently broke, and
turned their backs, and a very great number of them were
slain, and were taken captives, man, woman and child.
The prince, Hombiangymbe, was slain, which was ruler of
this country, and more than one hundred of his chief lords,
and their heads presented and thrown at the feet of the
great Gaga. The men, women and children that were
brought in captive alive, and the dead corpses that were
brought to be eaten, were strange to behold. For these
Gagas are the greatest cannibals and man-eaters that be in
the world, for they feed chiefly upon man&#8217;s flesh [notwithstanding
of their] having all the cattle of that country.</p>

<p>They settled themselves in this country and took the
spoil of it. We had great trade with these Gagas, five
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
months, and gained greatly by them. These Gagas were
not contented to stay in this place of Benguela, although
they lacked almost nothing. For they had great store of
cattle and wheat, and many other commodities; but they
lacked wine, for in these parts there are no palm-trees.</p>

<p>After the five months were expired they marched toward
the province of Bambala,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> to a great lord that is called
Calicansamba, whose country is five days up into the land.
In these five months&#8217; space we made three voyages to the
city of San Paul, and coming the fourth time we found
them not.</p>

<h4>[<i>March into the Interior.</i>]</h4>

<p>Being loth to return without trade, we determined to go
up into the land after them. So we went fifty on shore,
and left our ship riding in the Bay of Benguela to stay for
us. And marching two days up into the country we came
to a great lord which is called Mofarigosat; and coming
to his first town we found it burnt to the ground, for the
Gagas had passed and taken the spoil. To this lord we
sent a negro which we had bought of the Gagas, and [who]
lived with us, and bid him say that he was one of the great
Gaga&#8217;s men, and that he was left to carry us to the camp.
This lord bade us welcome for fear of the great Gaga,
but he delayed the time, and would not let us pass till
the Gaga was gone out of his country. This lord Mofarigosat,
seeing that the Gagas were clear of him, began to
palter with us, and would not let us go out of his land till
we had gone to the wars with him, for he thought himself
a mighty man having us with him. For in this place they
never saw [a] white man before, nor guns. So we were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
forced to go with him, and destroyed all his enemies, and
returned to his town again. Then we desired him that
he would let us depart; but he denied us, without we
would promise him to come again, and leave a white man
with him in pawn.</p>

<h4>[<i>Left as an Hostage.</i>]</h4>

<p>The Portugals and Mulatos being desirous to get away
from this place, determined to draw lots who should stay;
but many of them would not agree to it. At last they
consented together that it were fitter to leave me, because
I was an Englishman, than any of themselves. Here I was
fain to stay perforce. So they left me a musket, powder and
shot, promising this lord, Mofarigosat, that within two
months they would come again and bring a hundred men
to help him in his wars, and to trade with him. But all
was to shift themselves away, for they feared that he would
have taken us all captives. Here I remained with this
lord till the two months were expired, and was hardly used,
because the Portugals came not according to promise.</p>

<p>The chief men of this town would have put me to death,
and stripped me naked, and were ready to cut off mine head.
But the Lord of the town commanded them to stay longer,
thinking that the Portugals would come. And after that
I was let loose again, I went from one town to another,
shifting for myself within the liberties of the lord. And
being in fear of my life among them I ran away, purposing
to go to the camp of the Gagas.</p>

<h4>[<i>He joins the Jagas.</i>]</h4>

<p>And having travelled all that night, the next day I
came to a great town which was called Cashil, which stood
in a mighty overgrown thicket. Here I was carried into
the town, to the lord Cashil. And all the town, great and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
small, came to wonder at me, for in this place there was
never any white man seen. Here were some of the great
Gaga&#8217;s men, which I was glad to see, and went with these
Gagas to Calicansamba, where the camp was.</p>

<p>This town of the lord Cashil is very great and is so
overgrown with <i>Olicondie</i> [<i>baobab</i>]<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> trees, cedars,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> and palms,
that the streets are darkened with them. In the middle of
the town there is an image, which is as big as a man, and
standeth twelve feet high; and at the foot of the image
there is a circle of elephants&#8217; teeth, pitched into the ground.
Upon these teeth stand great store of dead men&#8217;s skulls,
which are [were] killed in the wars, and offered to this
image. They used to pour palm oil at his feet, and kill
goats, and pour their blood at his feet. This image is
called Quesango,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> and the people have great belief in him,
and swear by him; and do believe when they are sick that
Quesango is offended with them. In many places of this
town were little images, and over them great store of
elephants&#8217; teeth piled.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The streets of this town were paled with palm-canes,
very orderly. Their houses were round like a hive, and,
within, hanged with fine mats very curiously wrought. On
the south-east end of the town was a mokiso [<i>mukishi</i>]
which had more than three tons of elephants&#8217; teeth piled
over him.</p>

<p>From this town of Cashil I travelled up into the country
with the Gagas<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> two days, and came to Calicansamba,
where the great Gaga had his camp, and was welcome to
him. Among the cannibal people I determined to live,
hoping in God that they would travel so far to the westward
that we should see the sea again; and so I might
escape by some ship. These Gagas remained four
months in this place, with great abundance and plenty
of cattle, corn, wine, and oil, and great triumphing,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
drinking, dancing, and banquetting, with man&#8217;s flesh, which
was a heavy spectacle to behold.</p>

<p>At the end of four months they marched towards the
<i>Serras</i>, or mountains of Cashindcabar, which are mighty
high, and have great copper mines, and they took the spoil
all the way as they went. From thence they went to the
river Longa,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> and passed it, and settled themselves in the
town of Calango,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> and remained there five or six months.
Then we arose and entered into the province of Tondo,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
and came to the river Gonsa [Coanza],<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> and marched on
the south side of the river to a lord that was called
Makellacolonge, near to the great city of Dongo. Here
we passed over mighty high mountains, and found it very
cold.</p>

<p>Having spent sixteen months among these cannibals,
they marched to the westward again, and came along the
river Gonsa, or Gunza, to a lord that is called Shillambansa,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>
uncle to the King of Angola. We burnt his chief town,
which was after their fashion very sumptuously builded.
This place is very pleasant and fruitful. Here we found
great store of wild peacocks,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> flying up and down the
trees, in as great abundance as other birds. The old lord
Shillambansa was buried in the middle of the town, and
had a hundred tame peacocks kept upon his grave, which
peacocks he gave to his <i>Mokeso</i>, and they were called
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
<i>Angello Mokeso</i>,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> that is, the Devil&#8217;s or Idol&#8217;s Birds, and
were accounted as holy things. He had great store of
copper, cloth, and many other things laid upon his grave,
which is the order of that country.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>From this place we marched to the westward, along the
river Coanza, and came right against the <i>Serras</i> or mountains
of Cambambe, or Serras de Prata.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> Here is the great
fall of water, that falleth right down, and maketh a mighty
noise that is heard thirty miles. We entered into the
province of Casama,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> and came to one of the greatest
Lords, which was called Langere. He obeyed the great
Gaga, and carried us to a Lord called Casoch,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> which was
a great warrior, for he had some seven years before overthrown
the Portugals camp, and killed eight hundred
Portugals and forty-thousand negroes, that were on the
Portugals side. This Lord did stoutly withstand the
Gagas, and had the first day a mighty battle, but had not
the victory that day. So we made a sconce of trees after
their fashion, and remained four months in the wars with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
them. I was so highly esteemed with the great Gaga,
because I killed many negroes with my musket, that I had
anything that I desired of him. He would also, when they
went out to the wars, give charge to his men over me. By
this means I have been often carried away in their arms,
and saved my life. Here we were within three days&#8217;
journey of Massangano, before mentioned, where the
Portugals have a fort: and I sought means, and got to the
Portugals again with merchant negroes that came to the
camp to buy slaves.</p>

<h4>[<i>Military Organisation of the Jagas.</i>]</h4>

<p>There were in the camp of the Gagas twelve captains.
The first, called Imbe Calandola,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> their general, a man of
great courage. He warreth all by enchantment, and taketh
the Devil&#8217;s counsel in all his exploits. He is always making
of sacrifices<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> to the Devil, and doth know many times what
shall happen unto him. He believeth that he shall never
die but in the wars. There is no image among them, but
he useth certain ceremonies. He hath straight laws to his
soldiers: for, those that are faint-hearted, and turn their
backs to the enemy, are presently condemned and killed
for cowards, and their bodies eaten. He useth every night
to make a warlike oration upon an high scaffold, which
doth encourage his people.</p>

<p>It is the order of these people, wheresoever they pitch
their camp, although they stay but one night in a place, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
build their fort, with such wood or trees as the place
yieldeth: so that the one part of them cutteth down trees
and boughs, and the other part carrieth them, and buildeth
a round circle with twelve gates.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> So that every captain
keepeth his gate. In the middle of the fort is the general&#8217;s
house, intrenched round about, and he hath many porters
to keep the door. They build their houses very close
together, and have their bows, arrows, and darts standing
without their doors; and when they give alarm, they are
suddenly all out of the fort. Every company at their doors
[gates?] keep very good watch in the night, playing upon
their drums and <i>tavales</i>.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<h4>[<i>A River of Gold.</i>]</h4>

<p>These Gagas told us of a river that is to the southward
of the Bay of Vaccas,<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> that hath great store of gold: and
that they gathered up great store of grains of gold upon
the sand, which the fresh water driveth down in the time
of rain. We found some of this gold in the handles of
their hatchets, which they use to engrave with copper; and
they called it copper also, and do not esteem it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<h4>[<i>Palm Wine.</i>]</h4>

<p>These Gagas delight in no country, but where there is
great store of Palmares, or groves of palms. For they
delight greatly in the wine and in the fruit of the palm,
which serveth to eat and to make oil. And they draw
their wine contrary to the Imbondos.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> These palm-trees
are six or seven fathoms high, and have no leaves but in
the top: and they have a device to go up to the top of the
tree, and lay no hands on it, and they draw the wine in the
top of the tree in a bottle.</p>

<p>But these Gagas cut the palm-trees down by the root,
which lie ten days before they will give wine. And then
they make a square hole in the top and heart of the tree,
and take out of the hole every morning a quart, and at
night a quart So that every tree giveth two quarts of
wine a day for the space of six and twenty days, and then
it drieth up.</p>

<h4>[<i>Jaga Raids.</i>]</h4>

<p>When they settle themselves in any country, they cut
down as many palms as will serve them wine for a month:
and then as many more, so that in a little time they spoil
the country. They stay no longer in a place than it will
afford them maintenance. And then in harvest-time they
arise, and settle themselves in the fruitfullest place they
can find; and do reap their enemy&#8217;s corn, and take their
cattle. For they will not sow, nor plant, nor bring up any
cattle, more than they take by wars.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> When they come into
any country that is strong, which they cannot the first
day conquer, then their General buildeth his fort, and
remaineth sometimes a month or two quiet. For he saith,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
it is as great wars to the inhabitants to see him settled in
their country, as though he fought with them every day.
So that many times the inhabitants come and assault him
at his fort: and these Gagas defend themselves and flesh<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>
them on for the space of two or three days. And when
their General mindeth to give the onset, he will, in the
night, put out some one thousand men: which do ambush
themselves about a mile from their fort. Then in the
morning the great Gaga goeth with all his strength out of
the fort, as though he would take their town. The inhabitants
coming near the fort to defend their country, being
between them, the Gagas give the watchword with their
drums, and then the ambushed men rise, so that very few
escape. And that day their General overunneth the
country.</p>

<h4>[<i>Dress and Ornaments.</i>]</h4>

<p>The great Gaga Calando<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> hath his hair very long,
embroidered with many knots of Banba<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> shells, which are
very rich among them, and about his neck a collar of
<i>masoes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> which are also shells, that are found upon that
coast, and are sold among them for the worth of twenty
shillings a shell: and about his middle he weareth <i>landes</i>,
which are beads made of the ostrich eggs.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> He weareth a
palm-cloth about his middle, as fine as silk. His body is
carved and cut with sundry works, and every day anointed
with the fat of men.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> He weareth a piece of copper cross
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
his nose<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>, two inches long, and in his ears also. His body
is always painted red and white. He hath twenty or thirty
wives, which follow him when he goeth abroad; and one
of them carrieth his bows and arrows; and four of them
carry his cups of drink after him. And when he drinketh
they all kneel down, and clap their hands and sing.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>Their women wear their hair with high <i>trompes</i> full of
bamba [<i>mbamba</i>] shells, and are anointed with civet.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> They
pull out four of their teeth, two above and two below, for
a bravery. And those that have not their teeth out are
loathsome to them, and shall neither eat nor drink with
them. They wear great store of beads about their necks,
arms, and legs; about their middles, silk cloths.</p>

<h4>[<i>Infanticide.</i>]</h4>

<p>The women are very fruitful, but they enjoy none of
their children: for as soon as the woman is delivered of
her child, it is presently buried quick [alive], so that there
is not one child brought up in all this generation.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> But
when they take any town they keep the boys and girls of
thirteen or fourteen years of age as their own children.
But the men and women they kill and eat. These little
boys they train up in the wars, and hang a collar about
their necks for a disgrace, which is never taken off till he
proveth himself a man, and bring his enemy&#8217;s head to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
General: and then it is taken off and he is a freeman, and
is called <i>Gonso</i> or soldier.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> This maketh them all desperate,
and forward to be free, and counted men: and so they do
increase. In all this camp there were but twelve natural
Gagas that were their captains, and fourteen or fifteen
women. For it is more than fifty years since they came
from Serra de Lion, which was their native country.
But their camp is sixteen thousand strong, and sometimes
more.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<h4>[<i>Human Sacrifices.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></h4>

<p>When the great Gaga Calandola undertaketh any great
enterprise against the inhabitants of any country, he
maketh a sacrifice to the Devil, in the morning, before the
sun riseth. He sitteth upon a stool, having upon each side
of him a man-witch: then he hath forty or fifty women
which stand round about him, holding in each hand a
<i>zevra</i> [zebra]<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> or wild horse&#8217;s tail, wherewith they do flourish
and sing. Behind them are great store of petes, ponges,
and drums, which always play. In the midst of them is
a great fire; upon the fire an earthen pot with white
powders, wherewith the men-witches do paint him on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
forehead, temples, &#8217;thwart the breast and belly, with long
ceremonies and inchanting terms. Thus he continueth
till sun is down. Then the witches bring his <i>Casengula</i>,<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>
which is a weapon like a hatchet, and put it into his hand,
and bid him be strong against his enemies: for his <i>mokiso</i>
is with him. And presently there is a man-child brought,
which forthwith he killeth. Then are four men brought
before him; two whereof, as it happeneth, he presently
striketh and killeth; the other two he commandeth to be
killed without the fort.</p>

<p>Here I was by the men-witches ordered to go away,
as I was a Christian, for then the Devil doth appear to
them, as they say. And presently he commandeth five
cows to be killed within the fort, and five without the fort:
and likewise as many goats, and as many dogs, and the
blood of them is sprinkled in the fire, and their bodies are
eaten with great feasting and triumph. And this is used
many times by all the other captains of their army.</p>

<h4>[<i>Burial of the Dead.</i>]</h4>

<p>When they bury the dead they make a vault in the
ground, and a seat for him to sit.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> The dead hath
his head newly embroidered, his body washed, and anointed
with sweet powders. He hath all his best robes put on,
and is brought between two men to his grave, and set in
seat as though he were alive. He hath two of his wives
set with him, with their arms broken, and then they cover
over the vault on the top. The inhabitants when they die
are buried after the same fashion, and have the most part
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of their goods buried with them. And every month there
is a meeting of the kindred of the dead man, which mourn
and sing doleful songs at his grave for the space of three
days, and kill many goats, and pour their blood upon his
grave, and palm-wine also; and use this ceremony as long
as any of their kindred be alive.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> But those that have no
kindred think themselves unhappy men, because they have
none to mourn for them when they die. These people are
very kind one to another in their health; but in their
sickness they do abhor one another, and will shun their
company.</p>

<h4>&sect; IV.</h4>

<p class="indent3"><i>His return to the Portugals: invasions of diverse countries;
abuses; flight from them and living in the woods diverse
months; his strange boat, and coming to Loango.</i></p>

<h4>[<i>Jo&atilde;o Rodrigues Coutinho&#8217;s Campaign, 1602.</i>]</h4>

<p>Being departed from the Gagas I came to Masangano,
where the Portugals have a town of garrison. There was
at that time a new Governor, which was called Sienor Iuan
Coutinho,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> who brought authority to conquer the mines or
mountains of Cambamba; and to perform that service the
King of Spain had given him seven years&#8217; custom off all
the slaves and goods that were carried thence to the West
Indies, Brazil, or whithersoever, with condition that he
should build three castles, one in Demba,<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> which are the
salt mines, the other in Cambamba, which are the silver
mines, and the other in Bahia das Vaccas, or the Bay
of Cows.</p>

<p>This gentleman was so bountiful at his coming that his
fame was spread through all Congo, and many mulatoes
and negroes came voluntarily to serve him. And being
some six months in the city he marched to the Outaba of
Tombo,<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> and there shipped his soldiers in pinnaces, and
went up the river Consa or Coanza, and landed at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Outaba of Songo,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> sixty miles from the sea. This lord
Songo is next to Demba, where the salt-mines be. In this
place there is such store of salt that most part of the
country are perfect clear salt, without any earth or filth in
it, and it is some three feet under the earth as it were ice;
and they cut it out in stones of a yard long, and it is
carried up into the country, and is the best commodity
that a man can carry to buy anything whatsoever.</p>

<p>Here the Governor staid ten days, and sent a pinnace to
Masangano for all the best soldiers that were there. So
the captain of the castle sent me down among a hundred
soldiers, and I was very well used by the Governor; and
he made me a sergeant of a Portugal company, and then
he marched to Machimba,<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> from thence to Cauo, and then
to Malombe, a great lord. Here we were four days, and
many lords came and obeyed us. From thence we marched
to a mighty lord called Angoykayongo,<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> who stood in the
defence of his country with more than sixty thousand men.
So we met with him, and had the victory, and made a
great slaughter among them. We took captives all his
women and children, and settled ourselves in his town,
because it was a very pleasant place, and full of cattle and
victuals. And being eight days in this town the Governor
sickened and died, and left a captain in his room to
perform the service.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<h4>[<i>Manuel Cerveira Pereira carries on the war.</i>]</h4>

<p>After we had been two months in the country of
Angoykayongo we marched towards Cambambe, which
was but three days&#8217; journey, and came right against the
Serras da Prata, and passed the river Coanza, and presently
overran the country, and built a fort hard by the riverside.
Here I served two years.</p>

<p>They opened the silver-mines, but the Portugals did not
like of them as yet, because they yielded small share of
silver.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>This new upstart governor was very cruel to his soldiers,
so that all his voluntary men left him; and by this means
he could go no further.</p>

<p>At this time there came news by the Jesuits that the
Queen of England was dead, and that King James had
made peace with Spain.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> Then I made a petition to the
Governor, who granted me licence to go into my country;
and so I departed with the Governor and his train to the
city of St. Paul. But he left five hundred soldiers in the
fort of Cambambe, which they hold still.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<h4>[<i>A Trading Trip to Congo.</i>]</h4>

<p>Then I went with a Portugal merchant to the province of
Bamba, and from thence to the Outeiro [&#8220;hill&#8221;], or city standing
upon a mountain of Congo,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> from thence to Gongon<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and Batta,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> and there we sold our commodities and returned
in six months to the city [Loanda] again.</p>

<h4>[<i>Final Escape from Captivity.</i>]</h4>

<p>Then I purposed to have shipped myself for Spain, and
thence homewards. But the Governor denied his word,
and commanded me to provide myself within two days to
go up to the Conquest again. This Governor had served
his three years,<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> and the citizens looked every day for
another out of Portugal. So I determined to absent
myself for ten or twenty days, till the other Governor came,
and then to come to the city again. For every Governor
that cometh maketh proclamation for all men that be
absent, to come with free pardon.</p>

<p>The same day, at night, I departed from the city with
two negro boys that I had, which carried my musket and
six pounds of powder, and a hundred bullets, and that
little provision of victuals that I could make. In the
morning I was some twenty miles from the city, up along
the river Bengo, and there I staid certain days, and then
passed Bengo and came to the river Dande, which is to the
northward, purposing to know what news was in the city,
for I was near the highway of Congo. And one of my
negroes inquired of those that passed, and brought me
word that it was certain that the new Governor came not
that year.</p>

<p>Now I was put to my shifts, whether I would go to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
city again and be hanged, or to stay and live in the woods,
for I had run away twice before. So I was forced to live
in the woods a month, betwixt the rivers of Dande and
Bengo. Then I went to Bengo again, to Mani Kaswea,
and passed over the river, and went to the lake of Casansa.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>
Here is the greatest store of wild beasts that is in any
place of Angola. About this lake I staid six months, and
lived only upon dried flesh, as buffes [buffaloes], deer,
mokokes,<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> impolancas,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> and roebucks, and other sorts,
which I killed with my musket, and dried the flesh, as the
savages do, upon an hurdle, three feet from the ground,
making underneath it a great fire, and laying upon the
flesh green boughs, which keep the smoke and heat of the
fire down, and dry it. I made my fire with two little
sticks, as the savages used to do. I had sometimes Guinea
wheat [maize] which my negro boy would get of the
inhabitants for pieces of dried flesh.</p>

<p>This lake of Casanze doth abound with fish of sundry
sorts. I have taken up a fish that hath skipped out of
the water on shore, four feet long, which the heathen call
Sombo.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>Thus, after I had lived six months with the dried flesh
and fish, and seeing no end of my misery, I wrought
means to get away.</p>

<p>In this lake are many little island that are full of trees
called <i>Memba</i> [<i>bimba</i>]<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> which are as light as cork and as
soft. Of these trees I built a <i>lergado</i> [<i>Jangada</i>], with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
knife of the savages that I had, in the fashion of a box
nailed with wooden pegs, and railed round about, because
the sea should not wash me out; and with a blanket
that I had I made a sail, and prepared three oars to row
withall.</p>

<p>This lake of Casanza is eight miles over, and issueth
into the river Bengo. So I entered into my <i>gingado</i>
[<i>Jangada</i>], and my two negro boys, and rowed into the
river Bengo, and so came down with the current twelve
leagues to the bar. Here I was in great danger, because
the sea was great; and being over the bar I rode into the
sea, and then sailed afore the wind along the coast, which
I knew well, minding to go to the kingdom of Longo
[Loango], which is towards the north; and being that
night at sea, the next day I saw a pinnace come before
the wind, which came from the city, and was bound to
San Thom&eacute;, and she came near to me. The master was
my great friend, for we had been mates together, and for
pity&#8217;s sake he took me in, and set me on shore in the port
of Longo, where I remained three years, and was well
beloved of the king, because I killed him deer and fowls
with my musket.</p>

<h4><a name="V" id="V"></a>&sect; V.</h4>

<p class="indent3"><i>Of the Province of Engoy [Ngoyo], and other Regions of
Loango, with the Customs there observed by the King
and People.</i></p>

<h4>[<i>Kabinda.</i>]</h4>

<p>From the Point of the Palmar [Ponta do Palmar],<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> which
is the north side of the river Zaire, is the port of Cabenda
[Kabinda],<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> where many ships use to water and refresh
themselves; and it is five leagues northwards. This place
is called, Engoy [Ngoyo], and is the first province of Longo
[Loango], and is full of woods and thickets. And seven
leagues northwards of that place is the river Cacongo,<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> a
very pleasant place and fruitful. Here is great stock of
elephants&#8217; teeth, and a boat of ten tons may go up the river.</p>

<p>The Mombales<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> have great trade with them, and pass
the river Zaire in the night, because then it is calm, and
carry great store of elephants&#8217; teeth to the town of Mani
Sonna [Sonyo], and sell them in the port of Pinda to the
Portugals, or any other stranger that first cometh.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>At four leagues from Cacongo is the river of Caye, or
Longo Leuyes.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> This town of Caye [Kaia] is one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
four seats or lordships of Longo. And then the Angra, or
Gulf, das Almadias.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> In this gulf, or bay, are great store
of canoes or fishermen, because the sea is smoother there
than upon the coast. And two leagues northward is the
port of Longo [Loango]. And it is a sandy bay, and a
ship may ride within a musket-shot of the shore in four or
five fathoms.</p>

<h4>[<i>The Capital of Loango.</i>]</h4>

<p>The town of Mani Longo is three miles from the waterside,
and standeth on a great plain. This town is full of
palm and plantain-trees and very fresh, and their houses
are built under the trees. The streets are wide and long,
and always clean swept. The King hath his houses on the
west side, and before his door he hath a plain, where he
sitteth, when he has any feastings or matters of wars to
treat of. From this plain there goeth a great wide street,
some musket-shot from the place; and there is a great
market every day, and it doth begin at twelve of the clock.</p>

<p>Here is great store of palm-cloths of sundry sorts, which
is their merchandizes; and a great store of victuals, flesh,
hens, fish, wine, oil, and corn. Here is also very fine log
wood,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> which they use to dye withall&#8212;it is the root of the
log wood which is the best&#8212;and <i>molangos</i><a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> of copper. Here
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
is likewise great store of elephants&#8217; teeth, but they sell none
in the market-place.</p>

<h4>[<i>A Royal Audience.</i>]</h4>

<p>The King hath ten great houses, and is never certain to
be found but in the afternoon, when he cometh to sit.
And then he keepeth always [to] one house. The house is
very long, and at twelve of the clock it is full of noblemen.
They sit upon carpets upon the ground. The house is
always full of people till midnight.</p>

<p>The last king, Gembe [Njimbe],<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> never used to speak in
the day, but always in the night. But this king speaketh
in the day: howbeit he spendeth most of the day with his
wives. And when the king cometh in he goeth to the
upper end of the house, where he hath his seat, as it were
a throne. And when the king is set, they clap their hands
and salute him, saying in their language: <i>Byani Pemba</i>,
<i>Ampola</i>, <i>Moneya</i>, <i>Quesinge</i>.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<h4>[<i>The King&#8217;s Wives.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></h4>

<p>On the south side of the king&#8217;s houses he hath a circuit
[compound] or village, where his wives dwell, and in this
circuit no man may come on pain of death. He hath in
this place one hundred and fifty wives and more. And if
any man be taken within this circuit, if he be with a
woman, or do but speak to her, they be both brought into
the market-place and their heads be cut off, and their bodies
quartered, and lie one day in the street. The last king
Gymbe [Njimbi], had four hundred children by his women.</p>

<h4>[<i>The King Drinks!</i>]</h4>

<p>When the king drinketh he hath a cup of wine brought,
and he that bringeth it hath a bell in his hand, and as soon
as he hath delivered the cup to the king, he turneth his
face from the king and ringeth the bell; and then all that
be there fall down upon their faces, and rise not till the
king have drunk. And this is very dangerous for any
stranger that knoweth not the fashions, for if any seeth the
king drink he is presently killed, whatsoever he be. There
was a boy of twelve years, which was the king&#8217;s son. This
boy chanced to come unadvisedly when his father was in
drinking. Presently the king commandeth he should be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
well apparelled and victuals prepared. So the youth did
eat and drink. Afterward the king commandeth that he
should be cut in quarters and carried about the city, with
proclamation that he saw the king drink.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<h4>[<i>The King at Dinner.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></h4>

<p>Likewise for his diet, when it is dinner-time, there is a
house of purpose, where he always eateth, and there his
diet is set upon a <i>bensa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> like a table. Then he goeth in,
and hath the door shut. So when he hath eaten, then he
knocketh and cometh out. So that none see the king eat
nor drink. For it is their belief, that if he be seen eating
or drinking, he shall presently die. And this is an order
with all kings that now are, or shall succeed, unless they
abolish this cruel custom.</p>

<h4>[<i>The King as a Rain-maker.</i>]</h4>

<p>The king is so honoured as though he were a god among
them, and is called <i>Sambe</i> and <i>Pongo,</i><a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> that is God. And
they believe that he can give them rain when he listeth.
So once a year, when it is time to rain, that is in December,
the people come to beg rain and bring their gifts to the
king, for none come empty.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> Then he appointeth the day,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and all the lords far and near come to the feast with all
their troops, as they go in the wars. And when all the
troops of men be before the king, the greatest Lord
cometh forthwith his bows and arrows, and sheweth his
skill with his weapon; and then he hath a merry conceit or
jest that he speaketh before the king, and kneeleth at his
feet; and then the king thanketh him for his love; and in
like manner they do all.</p>

<p>The king sitteth abroad in a great place, and hath a
carpet spread upon the ground, which is some fifteen
fathoms about, of fine <i>ensacks</i>,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> which are wrought like
velvet, and upon the carpet his seat, which is a fathom from
the ground. Then he commanded his <i>Dembes</i> [Ndamba]<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>
to strike up, which are drums, so great, that they cannot
carry them, and others that are very great. He hath also
eight <i>Pongos</i>,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> which are his waits, made of the greatest
elephants&#8217; teeth, and are hollowed and scraped light, which
play also. And with the drums and waits they make an
hellish noise. After they have sported and shewed the
king pleasure, he ariseth and standeth upon his throne,
and taketh a bow and arrows in his hand, and shooteth to
the sky; and that day there is great rejoicing, because
sometimes they have rain. I was once there when the
king gave rain, and it chanced that day to rain mightily,
which made the people have a great belief in their folly.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<h4>[<i>Albinos.</i>]</h4>

<p>Here are sometimes born in this country white children,
which is very rare among them, for their parents are
negroes. And when any of them are born, they are presented
unto the king and are called <i>Dondos</i> [<i>Ndundu</i>].<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>
These are as white as any white man. These are the king&#8217;s
witches, and are brought up in witchcraft, and always
wait on the king. There is no man that dare meddle with
these <i>Dondos</i>. If they go to the market they may take
what they list, for all men stand in awe of them. The
King of Longo had four of them.</p>

<h4>[<i>The Nkishi, or Fetishes.</i>]</h4>

<p>The king also is a witch, and believeth in two idols
which are in Longo. The one is called <i>Mokisso &agrave; Longo</i>,
the other is called <i>Checocke</i>.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> This last is a little black
image, and standeth in a little house at a village called
Kinga, which standeth in the landing-place of Longo.
This house of <i>Checocke</i> standeth in the highway, and they
that go by clap their hands, which is the courtesy of the
country. Those that be craftsmen, as fishermen, hunters,
and witches, do offer to this idol, that they may have good
luck. This <i>Checocke</i> doth sometimes in the night come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and haunt some of his best beloved: sometimes a man,
sometimes a boy or a woman. And then they be frantic
for the space of three hours; and whatsoever the frantic
person speaketh, that is the will of <i>Checocke</i>. And they
make a great feast and dancing at his house.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>There is another <i>Mokisso</i> which is also in Kinga, and it
is called <i>Gomberi</i>. It is the name of a woman, and is in
a house where an old witch dwelleth, and she is called
<i>Ganga Gomberi</i>, which is, the Priest of <i>Gomberi</i>. Here
once a year is a feast made, and <i>Ganga Gomberi</i> speaketh
under the ground.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> And this is a common thing every
year. I have asked the negroes what it was, and they told
me that it was a strong <i>Mokisso</i> that is come to abide
with <i>Checocke</i>.</p>

<h4>[<i>Children are born White.</i>]</h4>

<p>The children in this country are born white, and change
their colour in two days to a perfect black. As, for
example, the Portugals, which dwell in the kingdom of
Congo, have sometimes children by the negro women, and
many times the fathers are deceived, thinking when the
child is born it is theirs, and within two days it proveth the
son or daughter of a negro; which the Portugals do greatly
grieve at, for they rejoice when they have a mulato child,
though it be a bastard.</p>

<h4>[<i>The Royal Princes.</i>]</h4>

<p>The town of Longo [Loango] standeth in the midst of
four Lordships, and is governed by four Princes, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
are the King&#8217;s sisters&#8217; sons, for the King&#8217;s sons can never
be kings. The first is Mani Cabango,<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> the second Mani
Salag, the third Mani Bock, the fourth Mani Cay. This
Mani Cay is next to be king, and hath his train and court
as a Prince. And when the King dieth he cometh presently
into the seat of the King. Then, Mani Bock
cometh to Cay, Mani Salag cometh to Bock, and Mani
Cabango cometh to Salag. And then they provide another
to go to Cabango, so there be four Princes that wait on
the King when their turns come.</p>

<h4>[<i>The Kings Mother.</i>]</h4>

<p>The mother of these Princes is called Mani Lombo,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> and
she is the highest and chief woman in all the land. She
maketh choice of her husband, and when she is weary of
him she putteth him away, and taketh another. Her
children are greatly honoured, and whosoever passeth by
them kneel down and clap their hands, which is the
courtesy of the country.</p>

<p>These Lordships are champaign grounds, and full of
corn and fruit.</p>

<h4>[<i>Palm Cloth.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></h4>

<p>The men in this kingdom make good store of palm-cloth
of sundry sorts, very fine and curious. They are never
idle: for they make fine caps of needlework as they go in
the streets.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<h4>[<i>The Royal Tombs.</i>]</h4>

<p>There is a place two leagues from the town of Longo,
called Longeri,<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> where all their kings be buried, and it is
compassed round about with elephants&#8217; teeth pitched in the
ground, as it were a Pale, and it is ten roods in compass.</p>

<h4>[<i>Europeans Committed to the Sea.</i>]</h4>

<p>These people will suffer no white man to be buried in
their land,<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> and if any stranger or Portugal come thither
to trade, and chance to die, he is carried in a boat two
miles from the shore, and cast into the sea. There was
once a Portugal gentleman, that came to trade with them,
and had his house on shore. This gentleman died, and
was buried some four months. That year it did not rain so
soon as it was wont, which beginneth about December, so
that they lacked rain for some two months. Then their
<i>mokisso</i> told them that the Christian, which was buried,
must be taken out of the earth, and cast into the sea; and
within three days it rained, which made them have a great
belief in the devil.</p>

<h4>&sect; VI.</h4>

<p class="indent3"><i>Of the Provinces of Bongo, Calongo, Mayombe, Manikesocke,
Motimbas: of the ape-monster Pongo: their Hunting,
Idolatries, and divers other observations.</i></p>

<h4>[<i>Bongo.</i>]</h4>

<p>To the eastward of Longeri is the Province of Bongo,
and it bordereth on Mococke, [of which] the great Angeca<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>
is king. In this place is great store of iron, and palm-cloth,
and elephants&#8217; teeth, and great store of corn.</p>

<h4>[<i>Cango.</i>]</h4>

<p>To the north-east is the great province of Cango,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> and
it is fourteen days journey from the town of Longo.
This place is full of mountains and rocky ground, and full
of woods, and hath great store of copper. The elephants
in this place do excel, and there are so many that the
people of Longo hath great store of elephants&#8217; teeth, and
bring them to the port of Longo.</p>

<h4>[<i>Calongo.</i>]</h4>

<p>To the northwards of Longo, three leagues, is the river
Quelle:<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> and on the north side is the province of Calongo
[Chilunga]. This country is always tilled, and full of corn,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and is all plain and champaign ground, and hath great
store of honey. Here are two little villages that show at
sea like two hummocks,<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> which are the marks to show the
port of Longo; and fifteen miles northward is the river
Nombo,<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> but it hath no depth for any bark to go in. This
province, towards the east, bordereth upon Bongo; and
towards the north upon Mayombe, which is nineteen leagues
from Longo along the coast.</p>

<p>[<i>Yumbe.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<p>The province of Mayombe is all woods and groves,
so overgrown that a man may travel twenty days
in the shadow, without any sun or heat. Here is no
kind of corn nor grain, so that the people liveth only
upon plantains and roots of sundry other sorts, very good,
and nuts; nor any kind of tame cattle, nor hens. But
they have great store of elephants&#8217; flesh, which they
greatly esteem, and many kinds of wild beasts; and great
store of fish. Here is a great sandy bay, two leagues to
the southward of Cape Negro, which is the port of
Mayombe. Sometimes the Portugals take logwood<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> in
this bay. Here is a great river called Banna.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> In the
winter it hath no bar, because the general winds cause a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
great sea; but when the sun hath his south declination,
then a boat may go in, for then it is smooth because of
the rain. This river is very great, and hath many islands,
and people dwelling in them. The woods are covered
with baboons, monkeys, apes and parrots, that it will fear
any man to travel in them alone. Here also are two kinds
of monsters, which are common in these woods, and very
dangerous.</p>

<h4>[<i>Gorillas and Chimpanzis.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></h4>

<p>The greatest of these two monsters is called <i>Pongo</i>
[<i>Mpungu</i>] in their language, and the lesser is called <i>Engeco</i>.
This <i>Pongo</i> is in all proportions like a man, but that he is
more like a giant in stature than a man; for he is very tall,
and hath a man&#8217;s face, hollow-eyed, with long hair upon his
brows. His face and ears are without hair, and his hands
also. His body is full of hair, but not very thick, and it is
of a dunnish colour. He differeth not from a man but in
his legs, for they have no calf. He goeth always upon his
legs, and carryeth his hands clasped upon the nape of his
neck when he goeth upon the ground. They sleep in the
trees, and build shelters from the rain. They feed upon
fruit they find in the woods and upon nuts, for they eat
no kind of flesh. They cannot speak, and have no more
understanding than a beast.</p>

<p>The people of the country, when they travel in the
woods, make fires when they sleep in the night. And in
the morning, when they are gone, the <i>Pongoes</i> will come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and sit about the fire till it goeth out, for they have no
understanding to lay the wood together. They go many
together, and kill many negroes that travel in the woods.
Many times they fall upon the elephants, which come to
feed where they be, and so beat them with their clubbed
fists and pieces of wood that they will run roaring away
from them.</p>

<p>Those <i>Pongoes</i> are never taken alive, because they are
so strong that ten men cannot hold one of them, but yet
they take many of their young ones with poisoned arrows.
The young Pongo hangeth on his mother&#8217;s belly, with his
hands clasped fast about her, so that when the country
people kill any of the females, they take the young one
which hangeth fast upon his mother. When they die
among themselves, they cover the dead with great heaps of
boughs and wood, which is commonly found in the forests.</p>

<p>[Purchas adds in a marginal note:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;He told me in a conference with him that one of these Pongos
took a negro boy of his, which lived a month with them, for they
hurt not those which they surprise at unawares, except they look
on them, which he [the boy] avoided. He said, their height
was like a man&#8217;s, but their bigness twice as great. I saw the
negro boy.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;What the other monster [the Engeco] should be he hath forgotten
to relate, and these papers came to my hand since his death,
which otherwise, in my often conferences, I might have learned.
Perhaps he meaneth the Pigmy Pongo-killers mentioned.&#8221;]</p>

<h4>[<i>Hunting Dogs.</i>]</h4>

<p>The Morombes<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> use to hunt with their country-dogs,
and kill many kinds of little beasts, and great store of
pheasants. But their dogs be dumb, and cannot bark at
all.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> They hang wooden clappers about their necks, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
follow them by rattling of the clappers. The huntsmen
have <i>Petes</i> [whistles], which they whistle their dogs withall.
These dogs, in all this country, are very little, with prickt
ears, and are for the most part red and dun. The Portugal
mastiff dog, or any other great dog, are greatly esteemed
because they do bark. I have seen a dog sold up in the
country for thirty pounds.</p>

<h4>[<i>The Maramba Fetish.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></h4>

<p>In the town of Mani Mayombe is a fetish called
Maramba, and it standeth in a high basket made like a
hive, and over it a great house. This is their house of
religion, for they believe only in him, and keep his laws,
and carry his reliques always with them. They are for the
most part witches, and use their witchcraft for hunting and
killing of elephants and fishing, and helping of sick and
lame men, and to forecast journeys, whether they shall
speed well or evil. By this Maramba are all thefts and
murders tried, for in this country they use sometimes to
bewitch one another to death. And when any dieth, their
neighbours are brought before the Maramba; and if it be
a great man that dieth, the whole town cometh to swear.
The order is, when they come before Maramba, to kneel
and clasp Maramba in their arms, and to say: <i>Emeno,
eyge bembet Maramba</i>, that is, &#8220;I come to be tried, O
Maramba.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> And if any of them be guilty, they fall down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
stark dead for ever. And if any of them that swear hath
killed any man or child before, although it may be twenty
years past, he presently dieth. And so it is for any other
matter.</p>

<p>From this place, as far as it is to Cape de Lopo Gonsalves,
they are all of this superstition. I was twelve
months in this place, and saw many die after this sort.</p>

<p>These people be circumcised,<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> as they are through
all Angola, except the kingdom of Congo, for they be
Christians. And those that will be sworn to Maramba<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>
come to the chief Gangas, which are their priests or men-witches,
as boys of twelve years of age, and men and
women. Then the Gangas put them into a dark house,
and there they remain certain days with very hard diet.
After this they are let abroad, and commanded not to
speak for certain days, what injury soever they be offered,
so that they suffer great penury before they be sworn.
Lastly, they are brought before Maramba, and have two
marks cut upon their shoulders before, like a half moon,
and are sworn by the blood that falleth from them, that
they shall be true to him. They are forbidden some one
kind of flesh and some one kind of fish, with many other
toys [trifles]. And if they eat any of this forbidden meat
they presently sicken, and never prosper.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> They all carry
a relique of Maramba in a little box, and hang it about
their necks, under their left arms.</p>

<p>The Lord of this province of Mayombe hath the ensign
or shape of Maramba carried before him, and whithersoever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
he goeth; and when he sitteth down it is set before him;
and when he drinketh his palm-wine the first cup is poured
at the foot of the <i>Mokiso</i> or idol, and when he eateth
anything, the first piece he throweth towards his left hand,
with enchanting words.</p>

<h4>[<i>Sette.</i>]</h4>

<p>From Cape Negro northward is a great Lord called
Mani Seat,<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> which has the greatest store of elephants&#8217; teeth
of any Lord in the kingdom of Longo, for his people
practice nothing else but to kill elephants. And two of
these negroes will easily kill an elephant with their darts.
And here is great store of logwood.</p>

<h4>[<i>Mani Kesock.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></h4>

<p>There is another Lord, to the eastward, which is called
Mani Kesock, and he is eight days&#8217; journey from Mayombe.
Here I was with my two negro boys to buy elephants&#8217; hairs
and tails. And in a month I bought twenty thousand,
which I sold to the Portugals for thirty slaves, and all my
charges borne.</p>

<p>From this place I sent one of my negro boys to Mani
Seat with a looking-glass. He did esteem it much, and
sent me four elephants&#8217; teeth (very great) by his own men,
and desired me to cause the Portugals, or any other ship,
to come to the northward of the Cape Negro, and he would
make fires where his landing place is, for there was never
yet any Portugal or other stranger in that place.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<h4>[<i>Pygmy Elephant-Hunters.</i>]</h4>

<p>To the north-east of Mani Kesock are a kind of little
people called Matimbas,<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> which are no bigger than boys of
twelve years old, but are very thick, and live only upon
flesh, which they kill in the woods with their bows and
darts. They pay tribute to Mani Kesock, and bring all
their elephants&#8217; teeth and tails to him. They will not enter
into any of the Marombos<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> houses, nor will suffer any to
come where they dwell; and if by chance any Maramba, or
people of Longo [Loango], pass where they dwell, they
will forsake that place and go to another.</p>

<p>The women carry bow and arrows, as well as the men,
and one of these will walk in the woods alone, and kill the
<i>Pongos</i> [gorillas] with their poisoned arrows. I have asked
the Marombos whether the elephant sheddeth his teeth or
no, and they say no! But sometimes they find their teeth
in the woods, but they find their bones also.</p>

<h4>[<i>Poison Ordeals.</i>]</h4>

<p>When any man is suspected of any offence he is carried
before the king, or before Mani Bomma [Mamboma],<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a>
which is, as it were, a judge under the king. And if it be
upon matter that he denieth, and cannot be proved but by
their oath, then the suspected person is thus sworn: they
have a kind of root which they call <i>Imbondo</i> [<i>mbundu</i>].<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>This root is very strong, and is scraped into water. The
virtue of this root is, that if they put too much of it into
water, the person that drinketh it cannot void urine, and so
it striketh up into the brain, as though he were drunk, and
he falleth down, as though he were dead. And those that
fall are counted as guilty, and are punished.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p>[Purchas adds, in a marginal note:&#8212;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;He told me that this root makes the water as bitter as gall (he
tasted it), and one root will serve to try one hundred. They
which have drunk and made water are cleared, before which, if
dizziness take them, they cry: <i>Undoke</i>, <i>Undoke</i>,<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> and presently
execute them. See my <i>Relations</i>, b. 7 c. 10, which I writ from his
mouth.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> Neither may this be ascribed to the virtue of the herb,
but to the vice of the Devil, a murderer and his instrument, the
<i>Ganga</i> or priest.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> And therefore that conjecture seems unprobable.
For how could an ordinary trial of life where are so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
many so perilous; and therefore curious (more than) spectators,
nor perceive this in so long and frequent experience, which costs
so many their dearest friends their dearest life? I think rather
that this was the transcriber&#8217;s conjecture. I remember no such
scruple in his narrations to me. Who knows not the Devil&#8217;s
ambition of Deity, and cruel misanthropy or man-hating? This
is his apish imitation of Divinity, and those rites prescribed for
trial in the case of jealousy, Numbers, v.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> In Guinea like trial is
made by salt, and also by the <i>Fetisseroes</i> pot. In <i>Benomotapa</i>
by water also; in the <i>Maramba</i> trial before [mentioned (see
p. 56)], and <i>Motamba</i> trial by hot iron in Angola;<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> the ploughshares
in olden times with us; and the trial of witches in
the East parts by water, etc., were not unlike in deceivable
superstition.&#8221;]</p>

<h4>[<i>Death and Witchcraft.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></h4>

<p>In this country none of any account dieth but they kill
another for him, for they believe they die not of their own
natural death, but that some other hath bewitched them
to death. And all those are brought in by the friends of
the dead which they suspect, so that many times there
come five hundred men and women to take the drink made
of the foresaid root <i>Imbonda</i> [<i>mbundu</i>]. They are brought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
all to the high street or market-place, and there the master
of the <i>Imbonda</i> sitteth with his water, and giveth everyone
a cop of water by one measure; and they are commanded
to walk in a certain place till they make water, and then
they be free. But he that cannot urine presently falleth
down dead, and all the people, great and small, fall upon
him with their knives and beat and cut him into pieces.
But I think the witch that giveth the water is partial, and
giveth to him whom he will have to die, the strongest
water, but no man can perceive it that standeth by. And
this is done at the town of Longo almost every week in
the year.</p>

<h4>&sect; VII.</h4>

<p class="indent3"><i>Of the Zebra and Hippopotamus; The Portugal Wars in
those parts; the Fishing, Grain, and other things
remarkable.</i></p>

<h4>[<i>Domestic Animals.</i>]</h4>

<p>In this kingdom there is no kind of tame cattle but
goats, for none other cattle will live here. Oxen and kine
have been brought hither, but they presently die. The
hens in this place do so abound that a man may buy thirty
for the worth of sixpence in beads.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></p>

<h4>[<i>Wild Birds.</i>]</h4>

<p>Here is store of pheasants, and great plenty of partridges
and wild fowl. Here is a kind of fowl that lives in the
land bigger than a swan, and they are like a heron, with
long legs and long necks, and it is white or black, and
hath in her breast a bare place without feathers, where she
striketh with her beak. This is the right Pelican, and not
those sea-birds which the Portugals call pelicans, which are
white and as big as geese, and these abound in this
country also.</p>

<h4>[<i>The Zebra.</i>]</h4>

<p>Here is also the <i>zevera</i> or zebra, which is like a horse,
but that his mane, his tail, his strakes and divers colours
down his sides and legs do make a difference. These
<i>zeveras</i> are all wild and live in great herds, and will
suffer a man to come within shot of them, and let them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
shoot three or four times at them before they will run
away.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p>

<h4>[<i>The Hippopotamus.</i>]</h4>

<p>Moreover, there are great store of sea or river horses,
which feed always on the land, and live only by grass, and
they be very dangerous in the water. They are the
biggest creature in this country, except the elephant.
They have great virtue in the claws of their left forefoot,
and have four claws on every foot, like the claws of an ox.
The Portugals make rings of them, and they are a present
remedy for the flux.</p>

<h4>[<i>Portuguese dealings with the Natives.</i>]</h4>

<p>The Portugals make war against the negroes in this
manner. They have out of Congo a nobleman, which is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
known to be a good Christian and of good behaviour.
He bringeth out of Congo some one hundred negroes that
are his followers. This <i>Macicongo</i> [<i>mwishi-Kongo</i>]is made
<i>Tandala</i>,<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> or general over the black camp, and hath
authority to kill, to put down Lords and make Lords, and
hath all the chief doings with the negroes. And when any
Lord cometh to obey he first cometh to Tandala and
bringeth his present, as slaves, kine and goats. Then the
Tandala carrieth him before the Portugal Governor, and
bringeth two slaves for the Governor&#8217;s page, before he
goeth in. Then he must have a great gift for the Governor,
which is sometimes thirty or forty slaves, besides cattle.
But when he cometh before the Governor he kneeleth
down and clappeth his hands, and falleth down with his
face upon the ground, and then he riseth and saith: &#8220;I have
been an enemy, and now I protest to be true, and never
more to lift my hand against you.&#8221; Then the Governor
calleth a soldier, which hath deserved a reward, and giveth
the Lord to him. This soldier seeth that he have no
wrong; and the Lord acknowledgeth him to be his master,
and he doth maintain the soldier and maketh him rich.
Also, in the wars he commandeth his master&#8217;s house to be
built before his own, and whatsoever he hath taken that
day in the wars, he passeth [divideth] with his master.
So that there is no Portugal soldier of any account, but
hath his negro <i>sova</i>, or Lord.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<h4>[<i>Fishing.</i>]</h4>

<p>They use upon this coast to fish with harping irons, and
wait upon a great fish that cometh once a day to fish along
the shore, which is like a grampus. He runneth very near
the shore and driveth great shoals of fish before him; and
the negroes run along the shore as fast as they are able to
follow him, and strike their harping irons round about him,
and kill great store of fish, and leave them upon the sand
till, the fish hath done feeding; and then they come and
gather their fish up.</p>

<p>This fish will many times run himself on ground, but
they will presently shove him off again, which is as much
as four or five men can do. They call him <i>Emboa</i>, which
is in their speech a dog, and will by no means hurt or kill
any of them.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></p>

<p>Also, they use in the bays and rivers, where shoal water
is, to fish with mats, which are made of long rushes,
and they make them of an hundred fathoms long. The
mats swim upon the water, and have long rushes hanged
upon one edge of the mat, and so they draw the mat in
compass, as we do our nets. The fishes, fearing the rushes
that hang down, spring out of the water and fall upon the
mat, that lyeth flat on the water, and so are taken.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<h4>[&#8220;<i>Corn.</i>&#8221;]</h4>

<p>They have four sorts of corn in Longo. The first is
called <i>Masanga</i>,<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> and it groweth upon a straw as big as a
reed, and hath an ear a foot long, and is like hempseed.
The second is called <i>Masembala</i>.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> This is of great increase,
for of one kernel there springs four or five canes, which are
ten foot high, and they bear half a pint of corn apiece.
This grain is as big as tares, and very good. Thirdly, they
have another that groweth low like grass, and is very like
mustard-seed: and this is the best.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> They have also the
great Guinea wheat, which they call <i>Mas-impoto</i>.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> This is
the least esteemed.</p>

<h4>[<i>Ground-nuts.</i>]</h4>

<p>They have very good Peason [peas], somewhat bigger
than ours, but they grow not as ours do; for the pods grow
on the roots, underneath the ground, and by their leaves
they know when they be ripe.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> They have another kind
of Peason, which they call <i>Wando</i>.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> This is a little tree,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and the first year that it is planted it beareth no fruit; but
after, it beareth fruit three years, and then it is cut
down.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></p>

<h4>[<i>Plantains, or Bananas.</i>]</h4>

<p>Their plantain trees bear fruit but once, and then are
cut down, and out of the root thereof spring three or four
young trees.</p>

<h4>[<i>Bees and the Baobab.</i>]</h4>

<p>They have great store of honey, which hangeth in the
<i>Elicondy</i> trees.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> They gather it with a hollow piece of
wood, or chest, which they hang in the top of the tree, and
once a year it is full, by smoke rewarding the laborious
creatures with robbery, exile, death.</p>

<p>[Purchas here adds in the margin, &#8220;out of Battell&#8217;s
own reports&#8221;:&#8212;</p>

<p class="small">This <i>Alicunde</i> or <i>Elicondi</i> tree is very tall and exceeding
great, some as big as twelve men can fathom, spreading
like an oak. Some of them are hollow, and from the
liberal skies receive such plenty of water, that they are
hospitable entertainers of thousands in this thirsty region.
Once have I known three or four thousand remain at one
of these trees, and thence receiving all their watery provision
for four and twenty hours, and yet not empty.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
The negroes climbed up with pegs of hardwood (which that
softer easily receiveth, the smoothness not admitting other
climbing), and I think that some one tree hold forty tuns
of water.</p>

<p>This tree affords not less bountiful hospitality to the
back than belly, yielding (as her belly to their bellies, so)
her back to their backs; excepting that this is better from
the younger trees, whose tenderer backs being more seasonable
for discipline, are so soundly beaten (for man&#8217;s fault,
whence came the first nakedness), whereby one fathom
cut from the tree is extended into twenty, and is presently
fit for wearing, though not so fine as the <i>Iuzanda</i><a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> tree
yields. This tree yields excellent cloth from the inner
bark thereof by like beating.]</p>

<h4>[<i>Palm Trees.</i>]</h4>

<p>Of their palm trees, which they keep with watering
and cutting every year, they make velvets, satins, taffetas,
damasks, sarsenets, and such like; out of the leaves,
cleansed and purged, drawing long threads and even, for
that purpose. They draw wine (as it is said) from the
palm-tree. There is another kind of palm-tree which
beareth a fruit good for the stomach and for the liver,
and most admirable.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></p>

<h4>[<i>A Crocodile Story.</i>]</h4>

<p>One crocodile was so huge and greedy that he
devoured an <i>Alibamba</i>,<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> that is, a chained company of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
eight or nine slaves, but the indigestible iron paid him his
wages, and murdered the murderer, found afterwards in
his belly. I have seen them watch their prey, hauling in
gennet, man, or other creature, into the water. But one
soldier thus wrapt in shallower water drew his knife, took
his taker in the belly, and slew him.</p>

<h5>ON THE</h5>
<h3>RELIGION AND THE CUSTOMS</h3>
<h6>OF THE PEOPLES OF</h6>
<h2>ANGOLA, CONGO AND LOANGO.</h2>

<hr />

<p class="small">The following notes on the religion and customs of the Negroes
of Angola, Congo and Loango, are taken from Book vii,
chapters ix and x, of <i>Purchas His Pilgrimage, or Relations of the
World and the Religions observed in all Ages and Places discovered
from the Creation unto this Present</i>. London (H. Fetherstone),
1617. This account is a compilation. Purchas quotes, among
others, Duarte Lopez, De Barros, Osorio, Marmol, and Du Jarric.
In what follows, we confine ourselves to the oral information
which Purchas received from his friends or acquaintances,
Andrew Battell and Thomas Turner.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Chap. IX, &sect; I.&#8212;Angola.</span></h4>

<h4>[<i>The Slave Trade.</i>]</h4>

<p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/m.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="M" /></span>ASTER THOMAS TURNER, one
that had lived a long time in Brasil,
and had also been at Angola, reported
to me<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> that it was supposed
eight and twenty thousand slaves
(a number almost incredible, yet such
as the Portugals told him) were yearly shipped from
Angola and Congo, at the Haven of Loanda.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> He named
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
to me a rich Portugal in Brasil, which had ten thousand of
his own, working in his <i>Ingenios</i><a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> (of which he had eighteen)
and in his other employments. His name was John du
Paus, exiled from Portugal, and thus enriched in Brasil.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a>
A thousand of his slaves at one time entered into conspiracy
with nine thousand other slaves in the country, and
barricaded themselves for their best defence against their
master, who had much ado to reduce some of them into
their former servitude.</p>

<h4>[<i>Fetishes.</i>]</h4>

<p>To return to Angola, we may add the report of another
of our countrymen, Andrew Battell (my near neighbour,
dwelling at Leigh, in Essex) who served under Manuel
Silvera Pereira,<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> Governor under the King of Spain, at his
city of St. Paul, and with him went far into the country of
Angola, their army being eight hundred Portugals and
fifty thousand Naturals. This Andrew Battell telleth that
they are all heathens in Angola. They had their idols of
wood in the midst of their towns, fashioned like a negro,
and at the foot thereof was a great heap of elephants&#8217;
teeth, containing three or four tuns of them: these were
piled in the earth, and upon them were set the skulls of
dead men, which they had slain in the wars, in monument
of their victory.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> The idol they call <i>Mokisso</i> [<i>Mukishi</i>],
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and some of them have houses built over them. If any be
sick, he accounteth it <i>Mokisso&#8217;s</i> hand, and sendeth to
appease his angry God, with pouring wine (which they
have of the palm tree) at his feet.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> They have proper
names of distinction for their <i>Mokissos</i>, as <i>Kissungo</i>, <i>Kalikete</i>,
etc., and use to swear by them, <i>Kissungo wy</i>, that is,
by <i>Kissungo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<h4>[<i>Trial by Ordeal.</i>]</h4>

<p>They have another more solemn oath in trial of controversies:
this trial is called <i>Motamba</i>,<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> for which purpose
they lay a kind of hatchet, which they have, in the fire, and
the <i>Ganga-Mokisso</i>, or <i>Mokisso&#8217;s</i> Priest,<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> taketh the same
red-hot, and draweth it near to the skin of the accused
party; and if there be two, he causeth their legs to be set
near together, and draweth this hot iron without touching
between them; if it burns, that party is condemned as
guilty, otherwise he is freed.</p>

<h4>[<i>Burial.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></h4>

<p>For the ceremonies about the dead, they first wash him,
then paint him, thirdly apparel him in new clothes, and
then bring him to his grave, which is made like a vault,
after it is digged a little way down, undermined, and made
spacious within; and there set him on a seat of earth, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
his beads (which they use on chains and bracelets for
ornament), and the most part of his goods, with him in his
last home. They kill goats and shed the blood in the
graves, and pour wine there in memorial of the dead.</p>

<h4>[<i>Dogs.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></h4>

<p>... Andrew Battell saith that the Dogs in these
countries are all of one sort, prick-eared curs of a mean
bigness, which they use also to hunt with, but they open
not (for they cannot bark), and therefore they hang clappers
made of little boards about their necks. He hath seen
a mastiff sold for three slaves....</p>

<h4>[<i>Quizama.</i>]</h4>

<p>This kingdom [of Angola] hath many lordships subject
thereto, as far as the sea-coast as Cape Negro. Towards a
lake called Aquelunda<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> lieth a country called Quizama, the
inhabitants whereof being governed after the manner of
a commonwealth, have showed themselves friendly to the
Portugals, and helped them in their wars against Angola.
The houses in Angola are made in fashion like a bee-hive.</p>

<h4>[<i>Women and the Moon.</i>]</h4>

<p>The women at the first sight of the new moon, turn up
their bums in despite, as offended with their menstruous
courses, which they ascribe unto her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>[<i>Horses&#8217; Tails.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></p>

<p>The men sometimes, in a valorous resolution, will devote
themselves unto some haughty attempt in the wars; and,
taking leave of the king, will vow never to return until
they bring him a horse-head, or some other thing, very
dangerous in the enterprise, and will either do it or die.
Horse-tails are great jewels, and two slaves will be given
for one tail, which commonly they bring from the River of
Plate, where horses are exceedingly increased and grown
wild. They will, by firing the grass round about, hem
the horses about with a fiery circle, the fire still straightening
and growing nearer till they have advantage enough to
kill them. Thus have the European cattle, of horse and
kine, so increased in the other world, as they spare not
to kill the one for their hides, and the other for their tails.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Chapter IX, &sect; II.&#8212;Of Congo.</span></h4>

<h4>[<i>A Crocodile Story.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></h4>

<p>... Andrew Battell told me of a huge crocodile
which was reported to have eaten a whole <i>Alibamba</i>, that
is, a company of eight or nine slaves chained together, and
at last paid for his greediness: the chain holding him
slave, as before it had the negroes, and by his undigestible
nature devouring the devourer; remaining in the belly of
him after he was found, in testimony of this victory. He
hath seen them watch and take their prey, haling a gennet,
man, or other creature into the water. A soldier thus
drawn in by a crocodile, in shallower waters, with his
knife wounded him in the belly, and slew him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Chapter IX, &sect; III.&#8212;Of their ... Strange
Trees....</span></h4>

<p>Having stated that they use in Congo to make &#8220;clothes
of the <i>Enzanda</i> tree,<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> of which some write the same things
that are reported of the Indian fig-tree,&#8221; that it sends forth
a hairy substance from the branches, which no sooner
touch the ground but they take root, and grow up in
such sort, that one tree would multiply itself into a wood
if nature set not some obstacle (a marginal note adds
that &#8220;Andrew Battell saith that the tree which thus
strangely multiplieth itself is called the <i>Manga</i> tree&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a>).
Purchas continues as follows:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;But more admirable is that huge tree called <i>Alicunde</i>,<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>
of which my friend Andrew Battell supposeth some are as
big (besides their wonderful tallness) as twelve men can
fathom. It spreads like a oak. Some of them are hollow,
and the liberal clouds into those natural casks disperse
such plenty of water, that one time three or four thousand
of them, in that hot region, continued four and twenty
hours at one of these, which yielded them all drink of her
watery store, and was not emptied. Their negroes climbed
up with pegs<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> (for the tree is smooth and not therefore otherwise
to be climbed, and so soft that it easily receiveth pegs
of harder wood, driven into her yielding substance with a
stone), and dipped the water, as it had been out of a well.
He supposed that there is forty tuns of water in some one
of them. It yielded them a good opportunity for honey,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
to which end the country people make a kind of chest,
with one hole in the same, and hang it upon one of
these trees, which they take down once a year, and with
fire or smoke chasing or killing the bees, take thence a
large quantity of honey.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> Neither is it liberal alone to the
hungry or thirsty appetite, but very bountifully it clothes
their backs, and the bark thereof, which, being taken from
the younger <i>Alicundes</i> [<i>nkondo</i>], and beaten, one fathom
which they cut out from the tree will by this means extend
itself into twenty, and presently is cloth fit for wearing,
though not so fine as that which the <i>Inzanda</i><a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> tree yieldeth.
[It serves them also for boats, one of which cut out in proportion
of a scute<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> will hold hundreds of men.&#8221;]<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> In a
further marginal note Purchas adds: &#8220;These boats, saith
Andrew Battell, are made of another tree, for the <i>Alicunde</i>
is of too spongy a substance for that purpose.&#8221;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Chapter X, &sect; I.&#8212;Of Loango.</span></h4>

<h4>[<i>Offerings.</i>]</h4>

<p>... Andrew Battell lived among them [the Bramas
of Loango]<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> for two years and a half. They are, saith he,
heathens, and observe many superstitions. They have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
their <i>Mokissos</i> or images [<i>nkishi</i>] to which they offer in
proportion to their sorts and suits;<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> the fisher offereth
fish when he sueth for his help in his fishing; the countryman,
wheat; the weaver, <i>Alibungos</i>,<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> [that is] pieces of
cloth; others bring bottles of wine; all wanting that they
would have, and bringing what they want, furnishing their
<i>Mokisso</i> with those things whereof they complain themselves
to be disfurnished.</p>

<h4>[<i>Funeral Rites.</i>]</h4>

<p>Their ceremonies for the dead are divers. They bring
goats and let them bleed at the <i>Mokisso&#8217;s</i> foot, which they
after consume in a feasting memorial of the deceased
party, which is continued four or five days together, and
that four or five several times in the year, by all his friends
and kindred. The days are known, and though they dwell
twenty miles thence, yet they will resort to these memorial
exequies, and, beginning in the night, will sing doleful and
funeral songs till day, and then kill, as aforesaid, and make
merry. The hope of this maketh such as have store of
friends to contemn death; and the want of friends to
bewail him makes a man conceive a more dreadful apprehension
of death.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<h4>[<i>Prohibitions&#8212;Taboo.</i>]</h4>

<p>Their conceit is so ravished with superstition that many
die of none other death. <i>Kin</i><a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> is the name of unlawful and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
prohibited meat, which, according to each kindred&#8217;s devotion,
to some family is some kind of fish; to another a
hen; to another, a buffe [beef]; and so of the rest: in
which they observe their vowed abstinence so strictly that
if any should (though all unawares) eat of his <i>Kin</i>, he
would die of conceit, always presenting to his accusing
conscience the breach of his vow, and the anger of <i>Mokisso</i>.
He hath known divers thus to have died, and sometimes
would, when some of them had eaten with him, make them
believe that they had eaten of their <i>Kin</i>, till, having sported
himself with their superstitious agony, he would affirm the
contrary.</p>

<p>They use to set in their fields and places where corn or
fruits grow, a basket, with goat&#8217;s horns, parrot&#8217;s feathers,
and other trash: this is the <i>Mokisso&#8217;s</i> Ensign, or token,
that it is commended to his custody; and therefore, the
people very much addicted to theft, dare not meddle, or
take anything. Likewise, if a man, wearied with his
burthen, lay it down in the highway, and knit a knot of
grass, and lay thereon; or leave any other note (known to
them) to testify that he hath left it there in the name of
his idol, it is secured from the lime-fingers of any
passenger. Conceit would kill the man that should transgress
in this kind.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p>In the <i>banza</i> [<i>mbanza</i>], or chief city, the chief idol is
named <i>Chekoke</i>.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> Every day they have there a market,
and the <i>Chekoke</i> is brought forth by the <i>Ganga</i>, or priest,
to keep good rule, and is set in the market-place to prevent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
stealing. Moreover, the king hath a Bell,<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> the strokes
whereof sound such terror into the heart of the fearful
thief that none dare keep any stolen goods after the sound
of that bell. Our author inhabited in a little reed-house,
after the Loango manner, and had hanging by the walls, in
a cloth case, his piece, wherewith he used to shoot fowls
for the king, which, more for the love of the cloth than the
piece, was stolen. Upon complaint, this bell (in form like
a cow-bell) was carried about and rung, with proclamation
to make restitution; and he had his piece next morning
set at his door. The like another, found in a bag of beans
of a hundred pound weight, stolen from him, and recovered
by the sound of this bell.</p>

<h4>[<i>Poison Ordeal.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></h4>

<p>They have a dreadful and deadly kind of trial in controversies,
after this manner: there is a little tree, or shrub,
with a small root (it is called <i>Imbunda</i>) about the bigness
of one&#8217;s thumb, half a foot long, like a white carrot. Now,
when any listeth to accuse a man, or a family, or whole
street, of the death of any of his friends, saying, that such
a man bewitched him, the <i>Ganga</i> assembleth the accused
parties, and scrapes that root, the scrapings whereof he
mixeth with water, which makes it as bitter as gall (he
tasted of it); one root will serve for the trial of a hundred
men. The <i>Ganga</i> brews the same together in gourds, and
with plantain stalks hitteth everyone, after they have
drunk, with certain words. Those that have received the
drink walk by, till they can make urine, and then they are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
thereby free&#8217;d. Others abide till either urine frees them,
or dizziness takes them, which the people no sooner perceive
but they cry, <i>Undoke, Undoke</i>,<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> that is &#8220;naughty witch&#8221;;
and he is no sooner fallen by his dizziness, but they knock
him on the head, and dragging him away, hurl him over
the cliff. In every Liberty<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> they have such drinks, which
they make in case of theft, and death of any person.
Every week it falls out that some or other undergoes this
trial, which consumeth multitudes of people.</p>

<h4>[<i>Albinos.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></h4>

<p>There be certain persons called <i>Dunda</i> [<i>ndundu</i>], which
are born by negro parents, and yet are, by some unknown
cause, white. They are very rare, and when such happen
to be born, they are brought to the king, and become great
witches: they are his councillors, and advise him of lucky
and unlucky days for execution of his enterprises. When
the king goes any whither the <i>Dundas</i> go with him, and
beat the ground round about with certain exorcisms before
the king sits down, and then sit down by him. They will
take anything in the market, none daring to contradict
them.</p>

<h4>[<i>The Gumbiri Fetish.</i>]</h4>

<p>Kenga is the landing-place of Loanga. They have
there an idol called <i>Gumbiri</i>, and a holy house called
<i>Munsa Gumbiri</i>,<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> kept and inhabited by an old woman,
where once a year is a solemn feast, which they celebrate
with drums, dances, and palm-wines; and then, they say,
he speaketh under the ground. The people call him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
<i>Mokisso Cola</i>,<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> or a strong <i>Mokisso</i>, and say, that he comes
to stay with <i>Chekoke</i>, the idol of the banza. That <i>Chekoke</i>
is a negro image, made sitting on a stool; a little house is
then made him. They anoint him with <i>Toccola</i> [<i>tacula</i>],<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a>
which is a red colour made of a certain wood, ground on a
stone, and mixed with water, wherewith they daily paint
themselves, from the waist upwards, esteeming it a great
beauty; otherwise they account not themselves ready. It
is for like purposes carried from hence to Angola.</p>

<h4>[<i>Possessed of the Fetish.</i>]</h4>

<p>Sometimes it falls out that some man or boy is taken
with some sudden enthusiasm, or ravishment, becoming
mad, and making a whooping and great clamours.</p>

<p>They call them <i>Mokisso-Moquat</i><a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> that is, taken of the
<i>Mokisso</i>. They clothe them very handsomely, and whatever
they bid in that fit (for it lasteth not very long), they
execute as the <i>Mokisso&#8217;s</i> charge.</p>

<h4>[<i>The Maramba Fetish.</i>]<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></h4>

<p><i>Morumba</i><a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> is thirty leagues northwards from hence, in the
Mani Loango&#8217;s dominions, where he [Battell] lived nine
months. There is a house, and in it a great basket, proportioned
like to a hive, wherein is an image called
<i>Morumba</i>, whose religion extendeth far. They are sworn
to this religion at ten or twelve years old; but, for probation
are first put in a house, where they have hard diet, and
must be mute for nine or ten days, any provocation to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
speak notwithstanding. Then do they bring him before
<i>Morumba</i>, and prescribe him his <i>Kin</i> [kina], or perpetual
abstinence from some certain meat. They make a cut in
his shoulder like to a half moon, and sprinkle the blood at
<i>Morumba&#8217;s</i> feet, and swear him to that religion. In the
wound they put a certain white powder in token of his
late admission; which, so long as it continueth, doth
privilege him to take his meat and drink with whomsoever
he pleaseth, none denying him the same, at free cost.</p>

<p>They also have their fatal trials before this image, where
the accused party, kneeling down and clasping the hive,
saith: &#8220;<i>Mene quesa cabamba Morumba</i>,&#8221; signifying that he
comes thither to make trial of his innocence;<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> and if he
be guilty he falls down dead; being free he is free&#8217;d.</p>

<p>Andrew Battell saith he knew six or seven, in his
being there, that made this trial.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Chap. X, &sect; III.&#8212;Of the Giacchi, or Iagges.</span><a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></h4>

<h4>[<i>Origin of the Jagas.</i>]</h4>

<p>... Andrew Battel lived (by occasion of the Portugals
treachery) with the Iagges a longer time than ever any
Christian or white man had done, namely, sixteen months,
and served them with their [his] musket in the wars;
neither could Lopez (saith he) have true intelligence
whence they came,<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> for the Christians at that time had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
but uncertain conjectures of them: neither after had the
Portugals any conversing, but by way of commerce; but
he, being betrayed, fled to them for his life, and after, by
stealth, escaped from them: the only European that ever
lived in their camp.</p>

<p>He saith they are called Iagges by the Portugals, by
themselves Imbangolas*<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> (which name argues them to be of
the Imbij and Gal&aelig; before mentioned) and come from
Sierra Liona;*<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> that they are exceeding devourers of man&#8217;s
flesh, for which they refuse beef and goats, whereof they
take plenty. They have no settled habitation, but wander
in an unsettled course.</p>

<h4>[<i>Infanticide among the Jaga.</i>]</h4>

<p>They rise in harvest, and invading some country, there
stay as long as they find the palms, or other sufficient
means of maintenance, and then seek new adventure.
For they neither plant nor sow, nor breed up cattle, and,
which is more, strange, they nourish up none of their own
children, although they have ten or twenty wives a man, of
the properest and comeliest slaves they can take. But when
they are in travail they dig a hole in the earth, which
presently receiveth in that dark prison of death the newborn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
creature, not yet made happy with the light of life.
Their reason is that they will not be troubled with education,
nor in their flitting wanderings be troubled with such
cumbersome burthens.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></p>

<p>Once, a secret providence both punisheth the father&#8217;s
wickedness, and preventeth a viperous generation, if that
maybe a prevention where there is a succession without
generation; and as Pliny saith of the Esseni (lib. v, c. 15),
<i>Gens &aelig;terna est in qua nepto nascitur</i>. For of the conquered
nations they [the Jaga] preserve the boys from ten
to twenty years of age, and bring them up as the hope of
their succession, like <i>Negro-azimogli</i>,<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> with education fitting
their designs. These wear a collar about their neck in
token of slavery, until they bring an enemy&#8217;s head slain in
battle, and then they are uncollared, free&#8217;d, and dignified
with the title of soldiers; if one of them runs away he is
killed and eaten; so that, hemmed in betwixt hope and
fear, they grow very resolute and adventurous, their collars
breeding shame, disdain, and desperate fury, till they
redeem their freedom as you have heard.</p>

<p>Elembe,<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> the great Iagge, brought with him twelve
thousand of these cruel monsters from Sierra Liona, and
after much mischief and spoil settled himself in Benguele,<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a>
twelve degrees from the Zone southwards, and there
breedeth and groweth into a nation. But Kelandula,
sometime his page, proceeds in that beastly life before
mentioned, and the people of Elembe, by great troops,
run to him and follow his camp in hope of spoil.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<h4>[<i>Human Sacrifices.</i>]</h4>

<p>They have no <i>fetissos</i>, or idols. The great Iagge, or
Prince, is master of all their ceremonies, and a great witch.
I have seen this Kelandula (sayth our author) continue a
sacrifice from sun to sun, the rites whereof are these:
himself sat on a stool, in great pomp, with a cap adorned
with peacocks&#8217; feathers (which fowls, in one country called
<i>Shelambanza</i>,<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> are found wild; and in one place, empaled
about the grave of the king, are fifty kept and fed by an
old woman, and are called <i>Ingilla Mokisso</i>, that is, Birds of
Mokisso).<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> Now, about him thus set, attended forty or
fifty women, each of them waving continually a zebra&#8217;s tail
in their hands. There were also certain Gangas, priests
or witches. Behind them were many with drums and
pipes, and <i>pungas</i><a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> (certain instruments made of elephants&#8217;
teeth, made hollow a yard and a half, and with a hole like
a flute, which yield a loud and harsh sound, that may be
heard a mile off). These strike and sound, and sing, and
the women wave (as is said) till the sun be almost down.
Then they bring forth a pot, which is set on the fire with
leaves and roots, and the water therein, and with a kind of
white powder the witches or Gangas spot themselves, one
on the one cheek, the other on the other; and likewise
their foreheads, temples, breasts, shoulders, and bellies,
using many enchanting terms, which are holden to be
prayers for victory. At sunset a Ganga brings his <i>Kissengula</i>,<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a>
or war-hatchet, to the Prince (this weapon they use
to wear at their girdles) and putting the same in his hands
bid him to be strong, [that] their God goes with him, and
he shall have victory. After this they bring him four or
five negroes, of which, with a terrible countenance, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
great Iagge with his hatchet kills two, and the other two
are killed without the fort. Likewise, five kine are slain
within, and other five without the fort; and as many goats
and as many dogs, after the same manner.</p>

<p>This is their sacrifice, at the end whereof all the flesh is,
in a feast, consumed. Andrew Battell was commanded to
depart when the slaughter begun, for their devil, or
<i>Mokisso</i> (as they said) would then appear and speak to
them.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></p>

<p>This sacrifice is called <i>Kissembula</i><a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> which they solemnise
when they undertake any great enterprise. There were
few left of the natural Iagges, but of this unnatural brood
the present succession was raised.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Introduction.</span></h5>

<p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/m.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="M" /></span>ASTER ANTHONY KNIVET joined the second expedition of
Thomas Cavendish, which left England
in August, 1591. He seems to
have served on board the <i>Roebuck</i>,
of which vessel one Cocke was
captain. Nothing in his narrative enables us to identify
this Cocke with the Abraham Cocke of Limehouse, who
was &#8220;never heard of more&#8221; after he parted from Battell
on the coast of Brazil in 1590, nor with the Abram
Cocke who, according to Knivet, put in at the Ilha Grande
in 1598, in the hope of making prizes of some of the
richly-laden Spanish vessels returning from the Rio de la
Plata. Battell, surely, may be supposed to have been
acquainted with the fate of his old shipmate, whilst Knivet
gives no hint that the Abram Cocke of the Ilha Grande
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
was the captain of the <i>Roebuck</i>, to whom he was indebted
for his life when Cavendish was about to throw him overboard
in Magellan&#8217;s Strait. It is, however, just possible
that there was but one Abraham Cock, who had not been
heard of for some time when Battell returned to England
about 1610.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></p>

<p>When Cavendish returned from Magellan&#8217;s Strait, he put
Knivet and nineteen other sick men ashore near St.
Sebastian, to shift for themselves. Knivet was ultimately
taken by the Portuguese; but they spared his life, and he
became the &#8220;bond-slave&#8221; of Salvador Corr&ecirc;a de S&aacute;, the
Governor of Rio de Janeiro; and apart from the time he
spent among the cannibal Indians, and on a voyage to
Angola, he remained with his master to the end, and
returned with him to Portugal in 1599.</p>

<p>My friend, Colonel G. Earl Church, to whom I applied
for an opinion on the trustworthiness of Knivet&#8217;s statements
with regard to Brazil, writes as follows:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday morning I spent at the R. Geo. Soc., refreshing
my memory of Knivet&#8217;s extraordinary adventures.
One must read them always bearing in mind the romantic
spirit of the age in which they were written, and the novel
surroundings in which every adventurer found himself in
the New World. Giving due weight to all this, I find
Knivet&#8217;s relation of his voyages singularly truthful, so far
as my knowledge of Brazil goes. What he states, excepting
in two or three minor particulars, clashes with no
geographical, descriptive, or historical point with which
I am familiar, and he often throws in a sentence which
relates to facts which no man could invent, and which
makes his narrative impressive with truthfulness. I utterly
discard Cavendish&#8217;s opinion of his men and companions
for Cavendish appears to have been one of the most cold-blooded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
freebooters who ever cut a throat or raided a
settlement or scuttled a prize.&#8221;</p>

<p>I regret not being able to write in terms equally favourable
of what Knivet claims to have experienced during his
visit to Angola and Kongo. Knivet says that he ran away
from bondage on June 27th, 1597, and that he reached the
&#8220;port of Angola&#8221; after a perilous voyage of five months,
that is in November. He then sailed up the Kwanza, and
reached Masanganu, where he remained three months,
when he was arrested in consequence of a requisition of his
master and sent back to Brazil, which he must have
reached before June, 1598. We should be quite prepared
to accept this part of his story if his description of Masanganu
did not show that he can never have been there.
Knivet, however, is not content with such modest honours,
but claims to have resided for some time at the court of
the King of Kongo, and to have fallen in the hands of the
Portuguese when on his road to Prester John&#8217;s country.
By them he was carried to Masanganu, where he lived
three months. These two accounts are absolutely irreconcilable.
As to the author&#8217;s astounding geographical
misstatements, I refer the reader to the notes appended to
his narrative.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">First Account</span> (<i>Purchas</i>, pp. 1220-2).</h4>

<p>Continually I desired my master to give me leave to get
my living, intending to come into my country, but the
Governor would not let me go from him. When I saw no
means to get leave of my master, I determined to run
away to Angola, for to serve the King as a soldier in
Massangano till such time that I might pass myself to the
King of Anyeca,<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> which warreth against the Portugals,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and so have come through Prester Johns country into
Turkey.</p>

<p>On the seven and twentieth day of June, 1597, I embarked
myself unknown to my master, in a small ship of
one Emanuell Andrea, for to come for Angola. In this
voyage we were driven so near the Cape of Good Hope
that we thought all of us should have been cast away, the
seas are there so great; and by reason of the current they
brake in such sort that no ship is able to endure. There
we brake both our main mast and our mizzen. It pleased
God to send us the wind Eastward, which brought us to our
desired harbour [of] Angola.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> We had been five months
in our voyage, and by that means other ships that departed
two months after us were there before us.</p>

<p>When I heard that there were ships of the River of
Ienero [Rio de Janeiro], I durst not go ashore for fear of
being known of some of the Portugals. The next day
after that we came into the harbour, there came a great
boat aboard us, to ask if we would sell any Cassava meal.
We told them we would, and asked them whither they
went with their boat. They answered, that they tarried
for the tide to go up to the River of Guansa [Kwanza] to
Masangano. Then I thought it a fit time for my purpose,
and so embarked myself in the bark. The Portugals
marvelled to see me go willingly to Masangano; for there
men die like chickens, and no man will go thither if he
can chose.</p>

<p>Nine days we were going up the River of Guansa
[Kwanza], in which time two Portugal soldiers died; the
country is so hot that it pierceth their hearts. Three days
after I had been in Masangano, Don Francisco de Mendosa
Fortado,<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> the Governor of the city of Kongo, having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
received a letter from Salvador Coria de Sasa [Salvador
Corr&ecirc;a de S&aacute;], who was his great friend, sent a Pursuivant
for me, who brought me by land through the King of
Kongo&#8217;s country, and in six days we came to a town called
Saint Francis<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> (where the Governor was), hard by the
kingdom of Manicongo.</p>

<p>When I came before the Governor he used me very
kindly in words, and asked me what I meant, to cast myself
away wilfully in Masangano. Then I told him how long I
had served Salvador Coria de Sasa; and in how many
dangers I had been for him and his Son, without ever
having any recompence of any of them, and therefore I
thought it better to venture my life in the King&#8217;s service,
than to live his Bond-slave. The Governor commanded
me to be carried to Angola, and charged a pair of bolts to
be put upon my legs, because I should not run away.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after I was sent back again in a Carvell
[caravel] of Francis Lewes, and in two months we arrived
in the River of Jenero [Rio de Janeiro], and I was carried
with my bolts on my legs before the Governor; when he
saw me he began to laugh and to jest with me, saying that
I was welcome out of England. So, after many jests he
spake, he bade pull off my bolts from my legs, and gave me
clothes and used me very well.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Second Account</span> (<i>Purchas</i>, pp. 1233-7).</h4>

<p>Angola is a kingdom of itself in Ethiopia, where first the
Portugals did begin to inhabit: The country of Angola
cometh along the coast; as Portugal doth upon Spain, so
doth Angola run upon the Kingdom of Longa [Luangu]
and Manicongo.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>In Angola the Portugals have a City called the Holy
Ghost,<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> where they have great store of Merchandise, and
the Moors do come thither with all kind of such things as
the country yieldeth; some bring elephant&#8217;s teeth, some
bring negro slaves to sell, that they take from other
kingdoms which join hard by them; thus do they use once
a week, as we keep markets, so do all the Blackamoors
bring hens and hogs, which they call gula,<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> and hens they
call Sange,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> and a kind of beast that they take in the
wilderness, like a dog, which they call ambroa:<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> then they
have that beast which before I have told you of, called
gumbe, which is bigger than a horse.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></p>

<p>The Blackamoors do keep good laws, and fear their King
very much; the King is always attended with the nobles
of his realm, and whensoever he goeth abroad, he has always
at the least two hundred archers in his guard, and ten or
twelve more going before him, singing and playing with
pipes made of great canes, and four or five young Moors
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
coming after him as his pages. After them follow all his
noblemen.</p>

<p>When there falleth out any controversy among them, they
crave battle of the King, and then they fight it out before
him. They come before the King and fall flat on their
breasts; then they rise up and kneel upon their knees,
stretching out their arms crying, <i>Mahobeque benge, benge</i>;<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a>
then the King striketh them on the shoulders with a horse-tail;
then they go to the camp, and with their bows they
fight it out till they kill one another. After the battle is
done, if any liveth, he that liveth falleth down before the
King in the same manner as he did when he went to the
field; and after a long oration made, he taketh the horse-tail
from the King&#8217;s shoulder, and waveth it about the King&#8217;s
head, and then layeth it on his shoulder again, and goeth
away with great honour, being accompanied with all the
nobles of the Court. The Moors of Angola do know that
there is a God, and do call God <i>Caripongoa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> but they
worship the sun and the moon.</p>

<p>The country is champaign plain, and dry black earth,
and yieldeth very little corn; the most of anything that it
yieldeth is plantons [plantains], which the Portugals call
<i>baynonas</i> [bananas], and the Moors call them <i>mahonge</i><a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> and
their wheat they call <i>tumba</i>,<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> and the bread <i>anou</i>; and if
you will buy any bread of them, you must say, <i>Tala cuna
auen tumbola gimbo</i>; that is, <i>Give me some bread, here is</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
<i>money</i>.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> Their money is called <i>gullginbo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> a shell of a fish
that they find by the shore-side; and from Brazil the
Portugals do carry great store of them to Angola.</p>

<p>These Moors do esteem very much of red, blue and yellow
cloths. They will give a slave for a span of cloth in
breadth, I mean, and the length of it, of the breadth of the
piece; those pieces of cloth they wear about their middles,
and under it they hang the skin of a great weasel before
them, and another behind them, and this is all the garments
that they wear. A weasel in their language is called <i>puccu</i>.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a>
You can do a Blackamoor no greater disgrace than to take
away his skin from before him, for he will die with grief if
he cannot be revenged.</p>

<p>The Portugals do mark them as we do sheep, with a hot
iron, which the Moors call <i>crimbo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> The poor slaves stand
all in a row one by another, and sing <i>Mundele que sumbela
he Carey ha belelelle</i>,<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> and thus the poor rogues are beguiled,
for the Portugals make them believe that they that have
not the mark is not accounted a man of any account in
Brazil or in Portugal, and thus they bring the poor Moors
to be in a most damnable bondage under the cover of love.</p>

<p>The country of Angola yieldeth no stone, and very little
wood: the Moors do make their houses all covered with earth.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
These houses are no bigger than a reasonable chamber,
and within are many partitions, like the cabins of a ship, in
such sort that a man cannot stand upright in them. Their
beds are made of great bulrushes sewed together with the
rinds of a tree. They do make cloth like spark of velvet
(but it is thinner) of the bark of a tree, and that cloth they
do call <i>mollelleo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></p>

<p>The elephants do feed in the evening and in the morning in
low marshes, as there be many. The Moors do watch which
way they come, and as soon as the elephants are at meat,
they dig great holes in the ground, and cover them with
sticks, and then they cover the pits with earth; and when
they have made all ready they go to the elephants and
shoot at them with their arrows; and as soon as the
elephants feel themselves hurt, they run at whatsoever they
see before them, following after the Blackamores that chase
them. Then they fall into the deep pits where, after they
are once in, they cannot get out.</p>

<p>The Moors of Angola are as black as jet; they are men
of good stature; they never take but one wife, whom they
call <i>mocasha</i>.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> These Moors do cut long streaks in their
faces, that reach from the top of their ears to their chins.
The women do wear shells of fishes<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> on their arms, and on
the small of their legs. The law amongst them is, that if
any Moor do lie with another&#8217;s wife, he shall lose his ears
for his offence. These Moors do circumcise their children,
and give them their names, as we do when we baptize.</p>

<p>Angola may very easily be taken, for the Portugals have
no forts to defend it of any strength.</p>

<p>The King<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> of Congo is the greatest King in all Ethiopia;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and doth keep in the field continually sixty thousand
soldiers, that do war against the King of Vangala,<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> and the
King of Angola; this King is a Christian, and his brother-in-law
of arms with the King of Spain. His servants of
his house are most of them all Portugals, and he doth
favour them very much.</p>

<p>The King is of a very liberal condition, and very favourable
to all travellers, and doth delight very much to hear
of foreign countries. He was in a manner amazed to hear
how it was possible Her Majesty [Queen Elizabeth] had
lived a maiden Queen so long, and always reigned in peace
with her subjects. When I was brought before the King,
and told him of my country, what plenty of things we had,
if the Portugals had not liked of it, they would interrupt
my speech, and the King would show himself very angry,
and tell them that every man was best able to speak of his
country, and that I had no reason but to tell him that which
was true.</p>

<p>The King of Congo, when he goeth to the camp to see
his army, rideth upon an elephant in great pomp and
majesty; on either side of the elephant he hath six slaves.
Two of them were kings, that he himself had taken in the
field; all the rest were of noble birth; some of them were
brothers to the King of Ancica, and some of them were of
the chiefest blood of the great King of Bengala. These
noble slaves, at every command of the King of Congo, do fall
flat on the ground on their breasts. When the King doth
ride, as you have heard, they carry a canopy, as it were a
cloth of state, over his head. His two secretaries, the one
a nobleman of Spain, the other a Moor, do ride next after
him. Before him goeth at the least five hundred archers
which are his guard; then there followeth a Moor, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
doth nothing but talk aloud in praise of the King, telling
what a great warrior he hath been, and praising his wisdom
for all things that he hath accomplished very honourably
to his great fame of such as knew him.</p>

<p>When this King of Congo cometh to his host, all the
soldiers, as he passeth, fall flat on their faces to the ground.
He never cometh into his host after any battle, but he
dubbeth at the least twenty Knights Portugals, and as
many Moors, giving them very great living according to
their callings, and the service that they have done. The
brother of this King was in Spain at my coming from thence
for ambassador from his brother.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></p>

<p>Here the Portugal Captain would have taken me perforce,
to have been a common soldier, but the King commanded
that they should let me go whither I would, and my determination
at that time was to have gone for the country of
Prester John [Abyssinia], for I had a great desire to see
the River of Nilo and Jerusalem (for I accounted myself as
a lost man, not caring into what country or kingdom I came)
But it was not the will of God that I should at that time
obtain my desire, for travelling through the kingdom of
Congo, to have gone to the kingdom of Angila,<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> it was my
fortune to meet a company of Portugal soldiers that went
to a conquest that the King of Spain had newly taken,
called Masangana; which place is on the borders of Anguca.
Here they made me serve like a drudge, for both day
and night I carried some stone and lime to make a fort.</p>

<p>It lyeth right under the Line, and standeth in a bottom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
in the middle of four hills, and about are many fogges [bogs]
but not one river.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> It is the unfirmest country under the sun.
Here the Portugals die like chickens. You shall see men in
the morning very lusty, and within two hours dead. Others,
that if they but wet their legs, presently they swell bigger
than their middles;<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> others break in the sides with a draught
of water. O, if you did know the intolerable heat of the
country, you would think yourself better a thousand times
dead, than to live there a week. There you shall see poor
soldiers lie in troops, gaping like camelians [camels?] for a
puff of wind.</p>

<p>Here lived I three months, not as the Portugals did,
taking of physick, and every week letting of blood and
keeping close in their houses when they had any rain,
observing hours, and times to go abroad morning and
evening, and never to eat but at such and such times. I
was glad when I had got anything at morning, noon, or
night; I thank God I did work all day from morning till
night; had it been rain or never so great heat, I had always
my health as well as I have in England.</p>

<p>This country is very rich. The king had great store of
gold<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> sent him from this place: the time that I was there,
the King of Angica had a great city at Masangana; which
city Paulas Dias, Governor of Angola, took and situated
there; and finding hard by it great store of gold, fortified
it with four forts, and walled a great circuit of ground round
about it, and within that wall; now the Portugals do build
a city, and from this city every day they do war against
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the King of Angica, and have burnt a great part of his
kingdom.</p>

<p>The Angicas<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> are men of goodly stature; they file their
teeth before on their upper jaw, and on their under jaw,
making a distance between them like the teeth of a
dog; they do eat man&#8217;s flesh; they are the stubbornest
nation that lives under the sun, and the resolutest in
the field that ever man saw; for they will rather kill
themselves than yield to the Portugals. They inhabit
right under the line, and of all kinds of Moors these are
the blackest. They do live in the law of the Turks, and
honour Mahomet. They keep many concubines, as the
Turks do; they wash themselves every morning upwards,
falling flat on their faces towards the east. They wear
their hair all made in plaits on their heads, as well men as
women; they have good store of wheat, and a kind of grain
like vetches, of which they make bread: they have great
store of hens like partridges, and turkeys, and all their
feathers curl on their backs. Their houses are like the
other houses of the kingdoms aforenamed.</p>

<p>And thus I end, showing you as brief as I can, all the
nations and kingdoms, that, with great danger of my life,
I travelled through in twelve years of my best age, getting
no more than my travel for my pain. From this kingdom,
Angica, was I brought in irons again to my master, Salvador
Corea de Sasa, to the City of San Sebastian in Brazil, as
you have heard.</p>

<h4>A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF KONGO</h4>
<h6>TO THE</h6>
<h5><span class="smcap">end of the seventeenth century.</span></h5>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Early History of Kongo.</span></h5>

<p><span class="floatLeft"><img src="images/i.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="I" /></span>F traditions may be accepted where
written history fails us, the foundation
of the Empire of Kongo lies back no
further than the middle of the fifteenth
century.</p>

<p>The founder of the dynasty and first
King of Kongo&#8212;Ntotela ntinu nekongo&#8212;was Nimi a
Lukeni, the son of Nimi a nzima and of Lukeni lua
nsanzi, the daughter of Nsa ku ki-lau. His father appears
to have been a mere village chief in Kurimba (Corimba),<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a>
a district of the kingdom of Kwangu. He had established
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
himself at a ferry on a great river (<i>nzari</i>), now known to
us as the Kwangu, and levied a toll upon all travellers who
crossed the stream. One day the young man&#8217;s aunt came
that way, and claimed exemption on the ground of being
the old chief&#8217;s sister. Her brother was absent, and not only
was the claim denied, but young Nimi a Lukeni, notwithstanding
that she was with child, caused her to be disembowelled.
The younger members of his clan looked
upon this act of brutality as one of bravery, and shielded
him against his father&#8217;s just wrath. He then placed himself
at their head, assumed the title of <i>ntinu</i> (king), and
started westward upon a career of conquest.</p>

<p>The country he was about to invade was inhabited by a
people kindred to those of Angola and of the country to
the north of the Zaire, split up into numerous small clans<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a>
ruled by independent kinglets. This, no doubt, would
account for the rapidity and the extent of his conquests,
which have been matched however, in our own days, by
the Makololo.</p>

<p>Having defeated Mbumbulu mwana Mpangala of
Mpemba-kasi, he founded his capital&#8212;Mbazi a nkanu&#8212;<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a>
upon a rock within that chief&#8217;s territory. By degrees he
extended his conquests southward to the Kwanza and
even beyond, installed his uncle Nsa ku ki-lau as ruler of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the important province of Mbata, bestowed large territories
upon others of his adherents, and even restored some
of their father&#8217;s territories to the children of the Mwana
Mpangala. His &#8220;sons,&#8221; attended by the great Nganga
Ngoyo, he sent across the Zaire, and they became the
founders of the &#8220;kingdoms&#8221; of Kakongo and Luangu;
whilst a third son, by a slave woman, is supposed to be
the ancestor of the &#8220;counts&#8221; of Sonyo or Soyo.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a>
Anciently the King of Kakongo, before he assumed his
kingship, was bound to marry a princess of the blood
royal of Kongo, whilst he of Luangu married a princess
of Kakongo; yet the ruler of Luangu was highest in rank,
for he enjoyed the title of <i>nunu</i> (&#8220;aged person&#8221;), whilst
his brother of Kakongo had to be contented with the
inferior title of <i>nkaji</i> (&#8220;spouse&#8221;). The Kings were elected
by the feudal princes, but their choice was limited to the
sons of princesses, as in a great part of negro Africa.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></p>

<p>Of the early institutions of Kongo we know next to
nothing, though we may presume that the law of succession
was originally the same there as in the sister-states to the
north, for the first Ntotela was succeeded by two nephews
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
(Nanga kia ntinu and another, whose name has not reached
us). But even thus early, and anterior to the introduction
of Christianity, the old law of succession was broken
through, for Nkuwu a ntinu, the fourth Ntotela, was a son
of Ntinu Nimi a Lukeni, and was succeeded by a son of his
own, Nzinga a Nkuwa, the first Christian Ntotela, better
known in history as John I.</p>

<p>If Dapper may be believed, it was the custom to bury
twelve virgins with the earlier kings&#8212;a distinction much
sought after, as in other parts of Africa; but the people of
Kongo have never been charged with cannibalism, nor its
rulers with the bloody rites practised by the Jaga.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">C&atilde;o&#8217;s Discovery of the Kongo</span>, 1482.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></h4>

<p>It was towards the end of 1482, that the natives at the
mouth of the River Kongo for the first time saw rising
above the horizon the white wings of a European vessel,
ascending, as it were, from the Land of Spirits; and we
can imagine their surprise when they for the first time
beheld the bleached faces of its inmates. Yet they came
on board, offering ivory in exchange for cloth. The interpreters
from the Guinea coast who were with C&atilde;o
naturally failed to make themselves understood, but they
learnt from signs that far inland there dwelt a powerful
king. C&atilde;o at once despatched some Christian negroes in
search of this potentate. They were the bearers of suitable
presents, and were instructed to assure the King of the
friendly intentions of his visitors, whose only desire it was
to trade with him.</p>

<p>Before continuing his voyage, C&atilde;o set up the first
of the stone pillars, or <i>padroes</i>, which he had on board.
He then sailed south along the coast, noting its prominent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
features, but curiously missed the Kwanza or River of
Angola, although its clayey waters discolour the sea for ten
or fifteen miles. On a low foreland, Cabo do Lobo,<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> ten
miles beyond the cliffs named by him Castello d&#8217;Alter
Pedroso, he set up a second pillar, to mark the furthest
point reached by him.</p>

<p>On again returning to the Kongo, he was annoyed to
find that his messengers had not returned; and as he was
naturally anxious to make known in Portugal his discovery
of a magnificent river and a powerful kingdom, he left
them behind him, and seized instead four unsuspecting
visitors to his ship as &#8220;hostages;&#8221; giving their friends to
understand that they should be restored to them after the
lapse of fifteen months, when they would be exchanged for
his own men. These latter appear to have been treated
with distinction at first, but when the King heard of C&atilde;o&#8217;s
high-handed proceedings he refused to admit them any
longer to his presence, and even threatened them with
death, should his own people not be restored.</p>

<p>Among the hostages carried off by C&atilde;o there was a
man of some distinction in his own country, Nsaku
(Ca&ccedil;uto) by name, who picked up Portuguese quickly, and
much pleased King John by the information he was able
to give. He, as well as his companions, were much petted
in Portugal, and, in defiance of all sumptuary laws, were
dressed in fine cloths and silks.</p>

<p>C&atilde;o himself, soon after his arrival, in April, 1484, was
appointed a cavalier in the Royal household, granted an
annuity of 18,000 reals, and on the 14th of that month
he was &#8220;separated from the common herd,&#8221; and granted a
coat-of-arms charged with the two pillars erected by him
during this memorable voyage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">C&atilde;o&#8217;s Second Voyage, 1485-6.</span></h4>

<p>C&atilde;o&#8217;s departure on a second voyage was much delayed,
either because the King&#8217;s Council were opposed to these
adventures, which strained the resources of a small kingdom
like Portugal, or&#8212;and this is more likely&#8212;because it
was desired that a change in the Royal Arms, which was
only made in June, 1485, should be recorded on the stone
pillars which C&atilde;o was to take with him.</p>

<p>Great was the rejoicing when C&atilde;o&#8217;s &#8220;fleet&#8221; appeared in
the Kongo, and the hostages, loud in praise of the good
treatment they had received, were once more among their
friends. C&atilde;o at once forwarded rich presents to the King,
with an invitation to throw aside all fetishes, and to
embrace the only true and saving faith; promising that, on
his return from a voyage to the south, he would personally
visit the capital of his kingdom. This promise C&atilde;o was
not permitted to fulfil, for having set up a pillar on Monte
Negro (15&deg; 40&acute; S.) and another on Cape Cross (21&deg; 50&acute;),<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a>
he died a short distance beyond. Of the details of his
death we know nothing.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> It seems, however, that the loss
of their commander induced a speedy return home: for
C&atilde;o&#8217;s vessels must have arrived in Portugal before August,
1487, as in that month Dias sailed on his famous voyage,
taking with him the negroes whom C&atilde;o had kidnapped to
the south of the Kongo, with a view to their learning
Portuguese, and being employed as interpreters in future
voyages.</p>

<p>C&atilde;o, therefore, never saw the King of Kongo; and there
are good grounds for believing that Nsaku who was sent by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the King to Portugal to ask for priests, masons, carpenters,
agricultural labourers, and women to make bread, only
reached Europe in one of Dias&#8217;s vessels, in December,
1488. Nsaku, most certainly, was first introduced to
King John at Beja, in January, 1489, when he and his
companions were baptised, the King himself, the Queen,
and gentlemen of title acting as sponsors.(312) He was
sent back to the Kongo with Don Gon&ccedil;alo de Sousa,
in December, 1490, about two years after he had been
baptised.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Embassy of 1490-1.</span><a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></h4>

<p>Don Jo&atilde;o de Sousa, the ambassador, left Portugal on
December 19th, 1490, with a fleet commanded by Gon&ccedil;alo
de Sousa, as captain-major. Among the pilots were Pero
d&#8217;Alemquer and Pero Escovar, men famous in the maritime
history of Portugal. Ten Franciscan Friars<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> went
out with this fleet, and so did Nsaku, the ambassador of
the King of Kongo. The plague was raging at Lisbon at
the time, and before the vessels reached the Cape Verde
Islands, this dreaded disease had carried off Jo&atilde;o de Sousa
(the ambassador), the captain-major, and many others.
Ruy de Sousa, a nephew of the captain-major, was then
chosen to take the place of D. Jo&atilde;o de Sousa.</p>

<p>After a voyage of a hundred days the vessels reached
the Kongo, and the Mwana of Sonyo and his son, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
had already been instructed in the Christian doctrine by a
priest from S. Thom&eacute;, were baptised on Easter Sunday,
April 3rd, 1491, and were thenceforth known as Don
Manuel and Don Antonio da Silva; for it was the practice
of the Portuguese, from the very beginning, to bestow
Portuguese names and titles upon the negroes who submitted
to the sacrament of baptism.</p>

<p>This ceremony performed, Ruy de Sousa started for the
King&#8217;s capital,<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> which he reached on April 29th. The
King received him seated on a platform, in a chair inlaid
with ivory. He wore a loin-cloth, presented to him by
C&atilde;o, copper bracelets, and a cap of palm-cloth. A zebra
tail depended from his left shoulder&#8212;a badge of royalty.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></p>

<p>The King was about to join his son Mbemba a Nzinga,
Duke of Nsundi, who had taken the field against the
Bateke;<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> but before doing so he was anxious to be baptised.
The foundations of a church having been laid on Rood
Day, May 3rd,<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> the King and his Queen were baptised at
once by Frei Jo&atilde;o de Santa Maria, and were named Don
Jo&atilde;o and Donna Leonor, after the King and Queen of
Portugal.</p>

<p>The King, marching for the first time under the banner
of the Cross, and supported by the firearms of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Portuguese allies, came back a victor to his capital. His
eldest son and many nobles were then baptised.</p>

<p>When Ruy de Sousa departed, he left behind him Frei
Antonio<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> with other priests, and gave instructions for an
exploration of the Kongo river above the cataracts, which
do not appear to have been acted upon. He also founded
a factory near the mouth of the Kongo, where the
enterprising people of S. Thom&eacute; had already established
commercial relations, although formal permission to do so
was only granted them by King Manuel on March 26th,
1500. Dom Pedro, a cousin of the King of Kongo,
accompanied him, with nine attendants, who, having been
taught to read and write, returned to their native country
with D. Jo&atilde;o Soares, early in 1494.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></p>

<p>The missionaries lost no time in preaching the doctrines
of their Church; but whilst Don Affonso proved an ardent
Christian, who recklessly destroyed all fetishes discovered
in his province of Nsundi, the King himself soon grew
lukewarm, owing to the priests&#8217; interference with polygamy
and other valued social institutions. In the country at
large, the heathen still held their ground.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">D. Affonso I</span>, 1509-1540.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></h4>

<p>And thus it happened that when Jo&atilde;o I died in 1509,
the chiefs favoured his second son, <i>Mpanzu a nzinga</i>,<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> a
heathen, whilst the dowager queen and the Count of Sonyo
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
took the part of the elder brother. Don Affonso, immediately
on hearing of his father&#8217;s illness, hurried up to the
capital, accompanied by only thirty-six Christians. He
found that his father had died. His brother approached
with a mighty army, but five flaming swords seen in the
heavens on the eve of battle gave courage to his small
following, whilst a white cross and the appearance of St.
James at the head of the celestial host struck terror into
the hearts of the assailants. They fled in a panic.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> Mpanzu
himself was taken, wounded, and decapitated.</p>

<p>Order having been restored throughout the country,
King Affonso availed himself of the presence of Gon&ccedil;alo
Rodriguez Ribeiro, who had come from Portugal with a
number of priests, and was about to return to that country,
to send an embassy to Pope Julius II and King Manuel.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a>
The head of this mission was Don Pedro (de Castro?), a
cousin of the King (who was accompanied by his wife), and
with him went D. Manuel, a brother of the King, and
D. Henrique, a son. The presents conveyed to Portugal
included seven hundred copper bracelets, elephant tusks,
slaves, parrots, civet cats and other animals, and native
cloth. D. Henrique remained behind at Rome, where he
was ordained and created Bishop of Utica in 1518.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></p>

<p>The mission sent by King Manuel in return was far-reaching
in its effects upon the political development of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Kongo.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> Of its magnitude we may judge when we learn
that it embarked in five vessels. Its leader, Sim&atilde;o da
Silva, dying on the road to S. Salvador, his place was taken
by Alvaro Lopes, the Royal factor. In his company were
priests, experienced soldiers, masons and carpenters to
build churches and a royal palace, and a lawyer (<i>leterado</i>)
to explain the law books which figured among the royal
gifts, besides horses, mules, cloth, banners, church furniture
and images. The ambassador was instructed to explain
the management of the royal household in Portugal, and
King Affonso quickly learnt the lessons he received, and
at once introduced the Portuguese titles of Duke, Marquis,
and Count. The ambassador likewise had with him an
elaborate coat-of-arms for the King,<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> and twenty less
ambitious heraldic designs for his principal noblemen; and
the monarch himself adopted a title closely imitated from
that of his &#8220;brother&#8221; of Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> The ambassador was
likewise instructed to make inquiries about the origin of
the Kongo in a lake, and to bring home cargoes of slaves,
copper and ivory.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>The King was delighted with all these gifts, not being
aware that by accepting them he virtually acknowledged
himself to be a vassal of the King of Portugal; and
he published a long manifesto to his people, in which he
dwelt upon his past career, the blessings of the Christian
faith, and the honours now done him. He actually read
the six bulky folios, but he told Ruy d&#8217;Aguiar (in 1516)
that if complicated laws like these were to be introduced
in his dominions, not a day would pass without a legal
offence of some kind being committed.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></p>

<p>The intercourse between Kongo and Lisbon must have
been very active in those days. We learn, for instance,
that in 1526 the King asked for physicians and apothecaries,
and in 1530 he forwarded to his &#8220;brother&#8221;
Manuel two silver bracelets, which he had received from
Matamba. Many young Kongoese were sent to Portugal
to be educated; but, to judge from a letter written by the
King in 1517, the results were not always very gratifying.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a>
Nay, he accuses Antonio Viera, to whom he entrusted
twenty young relations to be taken to Portugal, of having
parted with several among them to Mpanzu-alumbu, his
enemy, and of having left others behind him at S. Thom&eacute;.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a>
A second embassy left Kongo in 1540, to do homage to
Pope Paul III. It was headed by D. Manuel, a brother
of the King, who had been a member of D. Pedro&#8217;s
mission. King Affonso expected the King of Portugal
to pay 3,000 cruzados towards the expenses of this mission,
in consideration of the large profits which he derived from
the trade with Kongo.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></p>

<p>As a member of the Church militant, King Affonso
deserved well of the priesthood. He ruthlessly ordered all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
fetishes to be destroyed throughout his dominions, but
supplied their place with images of saints, crosses, agni dei,
and other ecclesiastical paraphernalia, which he held to be
more effectual. The clergy were numerous in his day, and
in addition to secular priests included Franciscans, Dominicans
and Austin Friars. They were wealthy, too, for
lands and slaves had been given them, and Christian
churches arose even in remote parts of the country. A
Franciscan friar, Antonio de D&eacute;nis (known in the world as
D. Diogo de Vilhegas) had been appointed Bishop of
S. Thom&eacute; and Kongo,<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> and took possession of his see in
1534, on which occasion exceptional honours were shown
him. He was a man of energy and much sincerity, but,
unhappily for his Church, survived only a few years. On
his death-bed he desired that D. Henrique, the King&#8217;s son,
whom he himself had ordained a priest, when in Rome,
and whom the Pope (as already mentioned) had created
Bishop of Utica in 1518, should succeed him in the episcopal
chair. The Pope, however, before he would consent
to the appointment of a native, desired personally to
inquire into the matter. D. Henrique went to Rome,
but died on the voyage home, in 1539 or earlier.</p>

<p>King Affonso deserved his reputation as a zealous
Christian, and had certainly proved himself a good friend
to the regular and secular clergy who undertook to convert
his people. Yet, as early as 1515, he had occasion to
call upon the King of Portugal to aid him in suppressing
the irregularities of these &#8220;unworthy preachers of the
Holy Catholic Faith,&#8221; whose inordinate desire of power
and covetousness brought scandal upon the Church, and
promised little for the future.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> Towards the close of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
reign, in 1540, one of these priests, Frei Alvaro, actually
attempted to assassinate the King, in church, and after
Mass!<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<p>The Portuguese living at the time in Kongo were
placed under a royal factor and a Corregedor (magistrate),
and enjoyed ex-territorial jurisdiction. They had
a factory at Mpinda, at the mouth of the Kongo, where
the King of Portugal levied heavy duties. The commercial
relations do not appear to have been at all times of the
most friendly nature. In 1514 the King complained that
Fern&atilde;o de Mello, the Governor of S. Thom&eacute;, traded with
the Mpangu-lungu<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> who were his enemies; and in 1526 he
remonstrated against the conduct of the Portuguese slave-merchants.
Indeed, so preposterous were the claims put
forward by the Portuguese officials, that King Affonso,
in 1517, humbly begged to be allowed to employ a
ship of his own when trading; or, at least to be exempted
from paying the heavy duties exacted by a foreign,
albeit suzerain, power upon the outlanders trading in his
kingdom. These ill-advised exactions explain, too, why
trade gradually deserted the Kongo, and sought more
favourable openings to the south, at Luandu, as is shown
by an inquiry held in 1548.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></p>

<p>The Portuguese made an effort to exploit the mineral
wealth of the country. Ruy Mendes, the &#8220;factor of the
copper mines,&#8221; is stated to have discovered lead; and
Gimdarlach (Durlacher?), a German &#8220;fundidor,&#8221; in 1593
discovered copper, lead, and silver. The King, however,
would not allow the mines to be worked, for he feared
that such a concession might cost him his kingdom.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Proposals for the exploration of the interior were made,
but bore no fruit. Greg&ograve;rio de Quadra, who had spent
several years as a prisoner among the Arabs, was sent
to Kongo in 1520, with instructions to make his way
thence to the country of Prester John. The King refused
his consent; Quadra returned to Portugal, and died a
monk.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> Balthasar de Castro, the companion of Manuel
Pacheco in Angola, desired to explore the upper Kongo in
1526; but neither his scheme nor that of Manuel Pacheco
himself, who was to have built two brigantines, seems to
have been carried out.</p>

<p>Of the domestic wars corned on by the King, we know
next to nothing. Angola and Matamba seem to have
been virtually independent in his day, though the island of
Luandu, with its valuable cowry-fishery, was held by him
and his successors until 1649. He conquered, however,
Mpanzu-alumbu (Mpangu-lunga?)<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> on the lower Kongo, a
district inhabited by a predatory tribe.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> That his successes
in these &#8220;wars&#8221; were due to his Portuguese mercenaries
and their fire-locks is a matter of course.</p>

<p>Don Affonso died in 1540, or soon afterwards, leaving
behind him a son, D. Pedro, who succeeded him, and three
daughters.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">D. Pedro and his Successors</span>, 1540-1561.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Pedro I</span> had been educated in Portugal, and is
described by Cavazzi as a wise prince who had inherited
all the virtues of his father, and was a great friend of the
missionaries. His reign was apparently a short one,<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a>
and he was succeeded by a cousin, <span class="smcap">D. Francisco</span>, who
only reigned two or three years, and left the kingdom to
a son,<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> <span class="smcap">D. Diogo</span>.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> Duarte Lopez describes this prince as
a man of noble mind, witty, intelligent, prudent in council,
an upholder of the missionaries, and at the same time a great
warrior who, in the course of a few years, conquered many
of the neighbouring countries. His &#8220;wars&#8221; certainly did
not enlarge the borders of his kingdom, and the only war
we know of ended in disaster. The Portuguese at S.
Salvador, jealous of the growing commercial importance of
Luandu, had persuaded the King to send an army against
Ngola Mbandi, they themselves furnishing an auxiliary
corps. The Kongoese, in spite of this, were defeated
on the river Dande (about 1556); and Ngola not only
appealed to Portugal for protection, but also allied himself
with the Jagas, with whose aid he invaded Kongo (in
1558).</p>

<p>Nor were the relations of D. Diogo with the missionaries
quite as friendly as Lopez would lead us to believe. As
early as 1549, D. Diogo complained of the overbearing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
conduct of the Jesuits who had arrived in that year in the
company of D. Jo&atilde;o Baptista, the Bishop of S. Thom&eacute;;<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> the
priests, on their side, accused the King of having shown
little respect to the bishop, and of having ordered them to
be pulled out of their pulpits, when they denounced his
vices and those of his people.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> The Jesuits may have
been over-zealous in the performance of what they conceived
to be their duty, and too prone to meddle in
politics; but they seem to have led clean lives, which cannot
be said of all of their clerical brethren. When D. Gaspar
C&atilde;o,<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> the Bishop of S. Thom&eacute; and Kongo, a man who
took the duties of his office seriously, visited S. Salvador,
these priests openly defied his authority. But after
several of the recalcitrant priests had been deported to
Portugal, whilst others had left voluntarily with such
wealth as they had been able to amass, discipline was
re-established.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Reign of Anarchy, 1561-1568.</span></h4>

<p>When Diogo died, about 1561, the Portuguese residents
endeavoured to secure the throne for one of their own
creatures, and caused the duly elected favourite of the
people to be assassinated. As a result, the people of
S. Salvador rose upon the Portuguese, many of whom were
killed, not even priests being spared. The accounts<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
this period of disorder are too confused to enable us
to be certain even of the names of the reigning kings.
<span class="smcap">D. Affonso II</span>, a son (probably illegitimate) of D. Diogo,
ascended the throne of his father, but was murdered by
his brother, <span class="smcap">D. Bernardo</span>, who appears to have been
the candidate favoured by the Portuguese. He at once
sent Father Estev&atilde;o de Laguos on an embassy to Queen
Catherine of Portugal, who, in a letter dated June 26th,
1562,<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> congratulated him upon his accession, whilst gently
chiding him for the murder of his brother. This King
was evidently friendly disposed towards the Portuguese;
and Antonio Vieira, a negro, who had visited Portugal as
member of an embassy, when writing to Queen Catherine
in April 1566,<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> suggested that he might be induced to
allow the mines of copper and tin to be worked. D.
Bernardo is stated by the Duke of Mbamba to have fallen
in a war with the Anzicas, &#8220;in defence of Christianity and
the Fatherland.&#8221; He was succeeded by <span class="smcap">D. Henrique</span>,
a brother of D. Diogo, who, after a short and troubled reign,
died of a wound received in a battle, either against some
revolted vassals,<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> or fighting the Anzicanas.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> He was the
last king of the original dynasty, for Alvaro I, his successor,
was only a step-son.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">D. Alvaro I and the Ayaka, 1568-1574.</span><a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></h4>

<p>D. Alvaro, immediately on his accession, sent an
embassy to Portugal, to apologise for the massacre of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
many Portuguese during the reigns of his predecessors,
which he excused on the ground of the vices and abuses of
the clergy. These excuses were apparently accepted in
Portugal, fortunately for D. Alvaro, for the very next year
the dreaded Ayaka<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> invaded his kingdom by way of
Mbata; and, being worsted, the King fled with his adherents
to the Hippopotamus Island,<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> on the lower Kongo,
where they suffered many hardships, and whence he
appealed piteously to the Portuguese for help. This help
was not denied him. Francisco de Gouvea, corregedor of
S. Thom&eacute;, in 1570, hastened to his aid with six hundred
Portuguese, expelled the Ayaka, reinstated the King in his
capital, and built a wall round S. Salvador for greater
security. The King fully recognised the value of the
service that had been rendered him, for Paulo Dias de
Novaes told Garcia Mendes<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> that he acknowledged himself
a vassal of Portugal;<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> and as neither gold or silver had
been discovered in his country, he agreed to pay a tribute
in <i>njimbos</i>, which he actually did for a few years.</p>

<p>No sooner was Alvaro once more seated securely upon
his throne than he sent the Count of Sonyo against Ngola
(1572). Several encounters took place in Musulu and
Mbuila (Ambuila); but in the end Ngola was allowed
to retain his father&#8217;s conquests, the river Dande being fixed
upon as the boundary between the two kingdoms. Kongo,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
however, retained possession of the valuable island of
Luandu.</p>

<p>Among other events of this reign we should mention a
second visit of D. Gaspar C&atilde;o, the bishop, shortly before
his death (in 1574); and the scandal caused by the burial of
a notorious inf&iacute;del, D. Francisco Mbula matadi, in the
church of S. Cruz, the roof of which was taken off by
night, and the body, carried away by the Devil!<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></p>

<p>D. Alvaro only enjoyed his prosperity for a short time,
for when Paulo Dias landed at Luandu, in 1575, he was
already dead.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">D. Alvaro II, 1574-1614.</span></h4>

<p>Alvaro II, a son of Alvaro I, is described by Bishop D.
Manuel Baptista as a &#8220;zealous Christian, father and friend
of all;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> but it is evident that he looked not with overmuch
favour upon the Portuguese residents in his country,
and he is charged, in a memoir addressed by Domingos
d&#8217;Abreu Brito to King Philip I, in 1592 with having
plotted with the kings of Ndongo and Matamba against
the Portuguese. An army which he sent ostensibly to the
aid of the Portuguese in 1583 retired, apparently without
striking a blow, whilst he furnished a contingent to the
forces of Matamba which invaded Angola in 1590. He
hindered, by specious excuses, the completion of a stone
fort at Mpinda, which had been commenced in 1609 by
Antonio Gon&ccedil;alves Pitta, until all the workmen had died.
He favoured Dutch traders to the great detriment of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Portuguese; and we know from Samuel Braun,<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> that an
effort was made in 1612 to expel the Dutch from the
Kongo, and that it would have been successful, had not
the natives sided with these heretical enemies, whose
dealings appeared to them to be more generous. Moreover,
the King, although he had promised Sebastian da
Costa (1580) that he would allow the supposed silver mines
to be sought for, eventually refused his consent.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></p>

<p>Turning to Church affairs, we hear of the usual applications
for missionaries, and of several episcopal visitations
by D. F. Antonio de Goiva (1578), D. Manuel de Ulhoa,
D. Miguel Baptista Rangel, and D. Manuel Baptista. D.
Manuel de Ulhoa presided over a synod at S. Salvador, in
1585, and laid down statutes for the government of his
see. D. Miguel Baptista Rangel was the first Bishop of
Kongo, which had been separated from the diocese of
S. Thom&eacute; by a Bull of May 20th, 1596. His successor,
D. Manuel Baptista, resided for several years in Kongo,
where he died in 1621; and a letter addressed to King
Philip II, in 1612,<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> speaks of the results of over a century
of missionary effort as insignificant, and describes the
people as incurable barbarians, full of vice.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">D. Pedro II Affonso</span>, 1622-1624.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Bernardo II</span>, a son of Alvaro II, only reigned for a
few months, for he was killed by his brother, <span class="smcap">Alvaro III</span>,
and a complaint addressed to him by the Governor of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Angola about the admission of heretical Dutchmen to
trade in Sonyo was answered by his successor. This
Alvaro III, the fratricide, is nevertheless described by
Cavazzi as having been &#8220;wise, modest, courageous, and
above all a zealous Christian.&#8221; It was during his reign, in
1619, that the Jesuits founded a college at S. Salvador.
A proposed mission of Italian Capuchins came to
nothing, for King Philip of Spain, by royal letters of
September 22nd, 1620, forbade foreign missionaries to
enter Portuguese colonies without first obtaining a royal
license.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> Alvaro III died on May 26th, 1622, and was
succeeded by <span class="smcap">D. Pedro II Affonso</span>, whom Cavazzi
describes as a son of Alvaro III; whilst a Jesuit canon of
S. Salvador,<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> who wrote an interesting life of this prince in
1624, makes him out to have been a son of Mbiki a
ntumba, Duke of Nsundi, and a descendant, in the female
line, of the first King of Kongo. If this biographer can be
trusted, he was a man of much promise, and of a mild,
forgiving temper; for although the Duke of Mbamba had
sought his life, he conferred upon him the marquisate of
Wembo. His reign was a short and troubled one. In
August, 1622, the Duke of Mbata had been killed by
rebels, and his vassal, the King of Kwangu (Ocango), had
suffered a defeat. Jo&atilde;o Corr&ecirc;a de Souza, the Governor of
Angola, summoned him to surrender Luandu Island and
all the copper mines; and this being refused, the Portuguese
under Luiz Gomez, aided by the Jagas, crossed the
Dande at Ikau and invaded Nambu a ngongo, and (in
December) also Mbumbi, where the Duke of Mpemba
and many others were killed and eaten by the Jagas, in
spite of their being Christians. The people of the invaded
districts revenged themselves by killing the Portuguese
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
living in their midst, the King vainly endeavouring to
protect them. These invaders had scarcely been driven
off, when Captain Silvestre Soares, with a body of Jagas,
entered Ngombe and Kabanda. But that which gave
most pain to the King was the destruction of the kingdom
of Bangu, and the murder of its King by the Jagas, with
the aid of the King of &#8220;Loango,&#8221; which was the &#8220;trunk
and origin of the kingdom of Kongo.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> In the midst of
these afflictions, the King was rejoiced to learn the arrival
of D. Sim&atilde;o Mascarenhas at Luanda; but he met with an
accident, and died on April 13th, 1624, after a short reign
of less than two years, and mourned by six sons and two
daughters.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">D. Pedro&#8217;s successors, 1624-1641.</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Garcia</span>, the eldest son of D. Pedro, when elected
was only twenty years of age, He was succeeded by
<span class="smcap">D. Ambrosio</span>, in October, 1626, whose reign, up till
March, 1631, was one continuous warfare with his powerful
vassals. The country became unsafe, and the Portuguese
retired for a time from S. Salvador. <span class="smcap">Alvaro IV</span>, a son
of Alvaro III, made himself master of the kingdom, and
retained possession until his death, February 25th, 1636.
He was succeded by his son, <span class="smcap">Alvaro V</span>, who, doubting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the loyalty of his half-brothers, the Duke of Mbamba and
the Marquis of Kiowa, made war upon them, was defeated
and taken prisoner, but liberated. Unmindful of the
generosity of his opponents, he once more tried the fortune
of battle, was taken again, and executed (in August, 1636).
The Duke of Mbamba was unanimously elected in his
place, and reigned, as <span class="smcap">Alvaro VI</span>, until his death on February
22nd, 1641. He waged two unsuccessful wars against
the Count of Sonyo, in 1636 and again in 1637; and was
obliged to surrender the district of Makuta (Mocata) to
his adversary.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Garcia II Affonso, o Kimbaku, 1641-1663,</span><a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></h4>

<p>the half-brother and old companion in arms of Alvaro
VI, took possession of the throne at a critical time; for in
August of the year of his accession, the Dutch captured
Luandu, and the fortunes of the Portuguese were at the
lowest ebb. The Dutch lost no time in sending an
embassy to Kongo (1642),<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> and these new allies lent him
their assistance in a small war against Mwana Nsala, who
had defied the royal authority.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> But they declined to give
effective help against a more powerful vassal, the Count of
Sonyo, as it might have interfered with their trade interests
on the Lower Kongo.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> The King&#8217;s army was defeated twice
on April 29th, 1645, when Affonso, the King&#8217;s son, was taken
prisoner, and again in July 1648, in the forest of Mfinda
angulu. Meanwhile the Dutch had broken the padr&atilde;o set
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
up by C&atilde;o at the mouth of the Kongo; they had re-named
S. Antonio&#8217;s Bay after their river Pampus at Amsterdam;
had gone to S. Salvador; and at least one of them, Johan
Herder,<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> had travelled far inland, and visited the Mwana
Nkundi on the Kwangu. The heretical tracts and books
which they liberally distributed were in due course burnt
by the Capuchin friars.</p>

<p>Portugal was, moreover, irritated by the admission of
Italian and Castilian Capuchins, a batch of whom, headed
by P. Bonaventura of Alessano,<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> arrived at S. Salvador,
on September 2nd, 1645, without having previously called
at Lisbon. This first mission was followed by three others
in 1648, 1651 and 1654,<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> and mission stations were established
in Mbata, in Nkusu, Nsundi, Mpemba, Mbwela,
and Wembo (Ovando).<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> Among the more noteworthy
missionary travels of the time was that of P. Girolamo
of Montesarchio, who visited Konko a bele (Concobello),
in 1652.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a></p>

<p>Even greater offence was given to Portugal by a mission
which the King despatched to Rome in 1646, and
which arrived there, by way of Holland, in May, 1648.
P. Angelo de Valenza, the head of this mission, had been
instructed to beg the Pope to appoint three bishops for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Kongo, Matamba and the Makoko&#8217;s country, without
reference to the claims of Portugal. This the Pope
declined to do; but to show his pleasure at receiving this
mission, he had a medal struck in memory of its visit, with
the inscription &#8220;Et Congo agnovit Pastorem,&#8221; and sent the
King a Royal crown blessed by himself. The King, however,
when his mission returned (1651), and when he heard
that the Pope had refused to change Kongo from an elective
into a hereditary monarchy, grew wroth. He openly
renounced Christianity, forbade the Capuchins to preach
the word of God, and recalled his native ngangas. But
when some bags containing relics and ornaments, which the
King had taken out of the churches, were miraculously
spared by a fire which broke out in his palace, he reconsidered
his position. A reconciliation with the Capuchins
was effected, and soon afterwards the King, in penitential
robes, actually marched at the head of a procession which
had been organised to turn away a threatened plague of
locusts; he allowed himself to be crowned by P. Giannuario
of Nola, in the name of his Holiness, and took an
active part in the celebration of the Pope&#8217;s jubilee.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Portuguese had recovered Luandu, and
the King was called upon to pay the penalty for having
made friendship with the Dutch heretics, and admitted
foreigners as missionaries. Bartholomeu de Vasconcellos
invaded Kongo. The King at once sent P. Domingos
Cardoso, a Jesuit, and the Capuchin Friar Bonaventura
Sardo, to Luandu, where they had an interview with the
Governor (on February 19th, 1649), and preliminary terms
of peace were arranged.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> The treaty was reported upon by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the <i>Conselho Ultramarino</i>, and confirmed in 1651 at Lisbon,
whither Friar Bonaventura<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> of Sorrento had gone to do
homage to the King of Portugal, on behalf of the Prefect
of the Capuchins, as also to plead the cause of his Order in
reference to the proposed treaty. The terms of this treaty,
as modified, were as follows:&#8212;Castilians or Dutchmen
not to be permitted to reside or travel in Kongo nor
their ships to be admitted, unless provided with a Portuguese
passport; the Capuchin friars to communicate with
Rome only by way of Luandu or Lisbon, and no Castilians
to be admitted among them; the Kings of Kongo
and Portugal to mutually assist each other if attacked by
an enemy; an ambassador of the King of Kongo to take
up his residence at Luandu, as also a royal prince, as
hostage, or in his absence two or three men of rank; compensation
to be granted for all the losses suffered by the
Portuguese since the arrival of the Dutch, and fugitive
slaves to be surrendered; Portuguese merchants to be
exempted from the payment of tolls; a site to be granted
at the mouth of the Kongo for a fortress; all gold and
silver mines to be ceded to the crown of Portugal, and
the country to the south of the river Dande to be ceded
absolutely; and finally the King of Kongo to acknowledge
himself a &#8220;tributario&#8221; of Portugal.</p>

<p>The King seems to have long hesitated before he ratified
this treaty, for in 1656, Diogo Gomes de Morales was
ordered to invade Kongo to enforce it, and was on the point
of crossing the river Loje into Mbamba, when he was
recalled, as envoys from the King had arrived at Luandu,
definitely to arrange the terms of peace.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>During the later years of his life, D. Garcia once more fell
away from his Christian teachers, whom he accused of
being influenced by political motives. Suspecting the
Duke of Mpemba of a desire to deprive his son of the
succession, he had him executed; and when the native
diviners accused his eldest son, Affonso, of aiming at his
life, he had his second son elected as his successor. He
died in 1663.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">D. Antonio I, 1663-66.</span></h4>

<p>D. Antonio had been enjoined by his dying father to
avenge the humiliation forced upon him by the Portuguese.
He inaugurated his reign by killing his own brother and
other relatives, whom he suspected of disloyalty. The
warnings of heaven&#8212;fiery balls, an earthquake, which
destroyed part of his capital, a plague, which decimated
the population&#8212;were disregarded by him.</p>

<p>He very soon found himself involved in a war with the
Portuguese, who claimed possession of the mines which
had been promised by treaty, and complained of raids
made upon friendly chiefs. On July 13th, 1665, the King
called upon his people to rise in defence of their country
and liberty.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> His diviners had promised him an easy
victory. The Portuguese had recently been reinforced
from Brazil, yet the army which they were able to put into
the field only numbered four hundred Europeans, with two
field guns and six thousand negroes. It was commanded
by Luiz Lopez de Sequeira, the captain-major, with
whom were Manuel Rebello de Brito, Diogo Rodriguez de
S&aacute;, Sim&atilde;o de Matos and Antonio Araujo Cabreira, the
serjeant-major. The hostile forces met on January 1st,
1666, at Ulanga, near the Pedras de Ambuilla.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> Antonio,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
seeing the small force opposed to him, hoped to gain an
easy victory; but the Portuguese, formed in square, resisted
the onslaught of his hosts for six hours. At last the King
left the ranks, desirous of a personal encounter with Lopez
de Sequeira; but he was shot down, his head was cut off,
and stuck upon a pike. His followers fled in dismay. The
missionaries assert that the Virgin Mary, with her Child,
was seen to stand by the side of the Portuguese leader,
directing the battle, and that a fiery rain fell upon the
idolaters.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></p>

<p>The Governor of Angola, in commemoration of this
victory, built the chapel of N.S. da Nazareth at Luandu,
whilst the King of Portugal amply rewarded the victors.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Time of Anarchy, after 1666.</span></h4>

<p>We are indebted to Pedro Mendes for an account of the
history of Kongo from the death of D. Antonio in 1666 to
the beginning of the eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> During that
time, according to this authority, there were fourteen Kings
of Kongo, of whom four were beheaded (or killed) by the
Musurongo, five by the Ezikongo, three died a natural
death, and two were survivors when he wrote, namely, D.
Pedro IV, at Salvador, and D. Jo&atilde;o at Mbula.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> At one
time there were actually three kings in the field.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alvaro VII</span>, a royal prince who had passed his early
life in retirement, but who, on being raised to the throne,
turned out a monster of iniquity, was killed by his own
subjects, abetted by the Count of Sonyo (1666), under
whose auspices took place the election of his successor,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">D. Alvaro VIII</span> (1666-70), who was in turn removed by
the Marquis of Mpemba. Alvaro VIII<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> had allowed the
Portuguese to search for gold, but this search turned out as
fruitless as the search for silver at Kambambe. Meanwhile
<span class="smcap">D. Affonso III Affonso</span> had been proclaimed at
Kibangu, the new capital (1667), whilst <span class="smcap">D. Pedro III</span>
<i>nsukia ntamba</i> was put up as an opposition King in
Mbula. The latter defeated his rival, who fled beyond the
Mbiriji (Ambriz), and died there (of poison?). His widow,
D. Anna, a daughter of a former King, Garcia, retired to
Nkondo (Mucondo), and survived her husband until 1680.
The people proclaimed <span class="smcap">D. Garcia III</span> <i>nenganga mbemba</i><a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a>
his successor, whilst the opposition, at the old capital
(S. Salvador), declared <span class="smcap">D. Daniel de Guzman</span>, descendant
of Mpanzu (Alvaro I), to be the rightful King. D. Daniel
took the field against D. Garcia III, but, before he reached
the residence of that King, he was overtaken by D. Pedro
of Mbula; his army was dispersed, and himself beheaded.
His children sought refuge with the Count of Sonyo, and
by treachery they succeeded in getting D. Pedro into their
power, and killed him. The people of Mbula thereupon
raised his brother, <span class="smcap">D. Jo&atilde;o</span>, to the throne, who survived
until after 1710. S. Salvador, after D. Daniel had deserted
it, became the haunt of wild beasts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile <span class="smcap">D. Rafael</span>, Marquis of Mpemba, who had
been proclaimed King some time anterior to this, had been
obliged to seek refuge among the Portuguese, and his
reinstatement was one of the objects of the disastrous
expedition of 1670,<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> by which it was sought to punish
Count Estev&atilde;o da Silva of Sonyo for his desecration of
Christian churches and the ill-treatment of Portuguese
traders: or, rather, his dealings with heretic competitors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>

</p><p>Jo&atilde;o Soares de Almeida, the commander of this expedition,
had with him five hundred Portuguese, supported by a
strong force of native allies, among whom was a Jaga
Kalandula. He won a battle, in which Estev&atilde;o was killed;
but Pedro, the brother of the unfortunate Count, rallied the
forces of Sonyo, unexpectedly fell upon the Portuguese
near the Mbiriji (Ambriz),and scarcely a man among them
escaped. Count Pedro then expelled the Italian Capuchins,
who were supposed to be friendly to Portugal, and invited
in their stead Belgian members of the same Order, who
arrived in September, 1673, under the lead of P. Wouters.
But, having been accused of stopping the rain, and having
in reply excommunicated the Count, they were speedily
expelled.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> Peace between Sonyo and Portugal was only
restored in 1690, when the former promised to abolish
idolatry and to sell no slaves to heretics.</p>

<p>It was about this period (between 1669 and 1675) that
Francisco do Mur&ccedil;a, the captain-major of Dande, visited
S. Salvador, and proceeded thence to Mbata and the
Kwangu, where he was told that this river flowed through
the kingdom of the Makoko, and entered the sea at
Mpinda, a fact long before known to the missionaries.
These latter had not quite abandoned the Kongo, notwithstanding
these troubles, and in 1668 the Capuchins still
occupied their monasteries at the capital of Mbamba and at
Mpembu;<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> whilst Girolamo Merolla (1682-88) and Antonio
Zucchelli steadily laboured (1700-02) in Sonyo and
Luangu.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. Andre</span> succeeded D. Garcia, but died after a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
short reign. <span class="smcap">D. Manuel</span> <i>nzinga elenge</i>, a descendant of
Mpanzu, was duly elected, but expelled by the sons of the
late D. Garcia, who raised <span class="smcap">Alvaro IX</span> to the throne in his
stead. This prince was never recognised by the Count of
Sonyo, who looked upon D. Manuel, who had sought
refuge with him, as the legitimate King. He was reinstated
by him for a time, but ultimately fell into the power
of his enemies, and was beheaded.</p>

<p>Alvaro IX was succeeded in 1694 by his brother <span class="smcap">Pedro
IV</span> <i>nsanu a mbemba</i>, also known as <i>agoa rosada</i>,<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> who once
more returned to the ancient capital. He and D. Jo&atilde;o of
Mbula were the only Kings alive in 1701, when the Capuchin
Friar Francisco de Pavia, and his colleague Friar Jo&atilde;o
Maria went throughout the kingdom of Kongo, preaching
peace, and calling upon the leading men to recognise
D. Pedro as their King; and thus put an end to quarrels
which had distracted the country for an entire generation.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Retrospect.</span></h4>

<p>And if we ask to what extent, and in what manner, have
the natives of Kongo been benefited by two centuries of
contact with the civilisation of Europe, and of missionary
effort, we feel bound to admit that they have not been
benefited at all&#8212;either materially or morally. On the
contrary. There were, no doubt, a few earnest men among
the missionaries, and the Church of Rome deserves some
credit for the zeal with which she addressed herself to the
object of converting the natives. At the same time it
cannot be denied that the instruments she employed, the
methods she pursued, and the surrounding circumstances,
were not favourable to success. And success there has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
been none&#8212;at least, none of an enduring nature&#8212;notwithstanding
the boastful, if not absolutely mendacious, reports
of her missionaries. The assertion that there was a time
when the whole of Kongo had become Roman Catholic
must raise a smile on the face of those who have attentively
studied the missionary reports. There were eleven
churches and a crowd of priests at the capital; but the
outlying provinces were but poorly attended to. The
number of missionaries, even including the native helpers,
was never large enough to administer, even to a tithe of the
population, those rites and sacraments, which the Roman
Catholic Church professes to be of essential importance.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></p>

<p>I quite agree with the Rev. J. Leighton Wilson, when he
says that the &#8220;great spiritual edifice&#8221; [raised by the missionaries]
has not only &#8220;crumbled into the dust, but it has left
the unfortunate inhabitants of that country in as deep
ignorance and superstition, and perhaps in greater poverty
and degradation, than they would have been if Roman
Catholicism had never been proclaimed among them.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a>
Father Jos&eacute; Antonio de Souza, who resided at S. Salvador
from 1881-87, and was subsequently created Bishop of
Mozambique, virtually admits this, for he says: &#8220;Christianity
did not penetrate deeply; it passed over the country
like a heavy rain, which scarcely wetted the surface of the
land, and left the subsoil absolutely dry and sterile.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> He
adds significantly: &#8220;By the side of the missionary stood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the slave-trader.&#8221; And surely it was the export slave
trade, created by the cupidity of the Portuguese, but shared
in by Dutch, French and English, which undermined the
prosperity of the country, and decimated its population.
And the missionaries never raised a protest against this
traffic, although it was against the tenets of their Church,<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a>
for they profited by it. The only thing which they did for
the wretched slaves was to endeavour to secure, as far as
possible, that they should not fall into the hands of
heretics; so that at least their souls might be saved, whatever
became of their bodies.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX IV.</h3>

<h4>A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF ANGOLA</h4>
<h6>TO THE</h6>
<h5>END OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.</h5>

<h5><span class="smcap">Early Portuguese Visitors.</span></h5>

<p>The inhabitants of S. Thom&eacute; were granted
permission in 1500<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> to trade as far as
the Kongo river; but it is just possible
that long before that time, and notwithstanding
an interdict of 1504, they
had felt their way southward along the
coast, and had discovered that a profitable trade, not
hampered by the presence of royal officials or &#8220;farmers,&#8221;
might be carried on at Luandu, and up a river which, after
the King of the country, was called the river of Ngola
(Angola).</p>

<p>Several years afterwards, a representative of this Ngola,
whilst on a visit at S. Salvador, suggested that missionaries
should be sent to convert his master. King Manuel was
nothing loth to act upon this suggestion, and entrusted
Manuel Pacheco and Balthasar de Castro, both of whom
were old residents in Kongo, with an expedition, whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
main object was to report on the missionary and commercial
prospects in Ngola&#8217;s country, to inquire into the
existence of reputed silver mines, and, eventually, to
explore the coast as far as the Cape of Good Hope. On
arriving at the bar of Ngola&#8217;s river (the Kwanza), B. de
Castro was to go to the King&#8217;s court, where, if circumstances
were favourable, he was to be joined by a priest.
Pacheco himself was to return to Portugal, with a cargo of
slaves, ivory, and silver.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a></p>

<p>No report of this mission has hitherto seen the light;
but we know that B. de Castro actually reached Ngola&#8217;s
residence, and that he was retained there as a prisoner,
until released in 1526, through the intervention of the King
of Kongo. He reported that he never saw silver or precious
stones anywhere in Angola.<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Early History of Ndongo (Angola).</span></h4>

<p>Ndongo is the original name of the vast territory now
known as Angola, from the name or title of its ruler
(Ngola) when first the Portuguese became acquainted with
it. The early history of this region is involved in obscurity,
but it seems that its chiefs at one time owed allegiance to
the King of Kongo, whose authority was finally shaken off
about the middle of the sixteenth century, the King only
keeping possession of Luandu island and its valuable
<i>njimbu</i> fishery.</p>

<p>Cavazzi, Antonio Laudati of Gaeta, Cadornega, and
others, have published long lists of Kings of &#8220;Angola;&#8221;
but nearly all the names they give are not those of the
Kings, but the titles which they assumed,<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> and by which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
they were generally known. The full title of the King of
Ndongo was <i>Ngola kiluanji kia Samba</i>,<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> and that title is
still borne by the present ruler, who claims to be a
descendant of the kings of old, and whose <i>Kabasa</i><a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> on the
River Hamba (Va-umba or Umba) still occupies the
locality assigned by the missionaries to Queen Nzinga&#8217;s
<i>Kabasa</i>, where they built the church of S. Maria of
Matamba.</p>

<p>Cavazzi&#8217;s Matamba, however, included the whole of
Queen Nzinga&#8217;s kingdom, as it existed in his day, whilst
the original Matamba, as also the country known by that
name in the present day, had much narrower limits. It
was originally tributary to Kongo, but one of its rulers
assumed the title of <i>Kambulu</i>, that is, King, and renounced
all vassalage to his former suzerain. It existed as an
independent kingdom until 1627, when the famous
Queen Nzinga took prisoner the dowager Queen, Muongo
Matamba, and incorporated this ancient kingdom in her
own dominions.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></p>

<p>It may have been a Ngola kiluanji, described by Cavazzi
as the son of Tumba ria ngola and of a Ngola kiluanji kia
Samba, who first invaded lower Ndongo, and assigned his
conquest to one of his sons. But all is uncertainty, and
there exists an inextricable confusion in the names of the
Kings of upper and lower Ndongo as transmitted to us.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
One thing, however, is certain, namely, that as early as
1520 the country down to the sea was held by a king
bearing the name or title of Ngola.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The First Expedition of Paulo Dias de
Novaes, 1560.</span></h4>

<p>In 1556 Ngola Ineve,<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> being threatened by Kongo, sent
an ambassador to Portugal asking for the establishment of
friendly relations. This ambassador arriving in the year
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
of the death of King John III (1557), action was deferred
until 1559, when three caravels were fitted out and placed
under the command of Paulo Dias, a grandson of the
discoverer of the Cape of Good Hope. Dias left Lisbon on
December 22nd, 1559, and called at S. Thom&eacute; (where Bishop
Gaspar C&atilde;o observed that the Jesuits, who accompanied
Dias, would meet with no success as long as commercial
intercourse was prohibited).<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> Dias arrived at the bar of the
Kwanza on May 3rd, and there waited patiently for six
months, when Musungu, a native chief, made his appearance
at the head of a crew of painted warriors, armed with
bows and arrows. In his company Dias, accompanied by
the Jesuit fathers and twenty men, travelled up the country
for sixty leagues, when he arrived at the royal residence.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a>
The King, not any longer the Ngola who had asked for
missionaries, but his successor,<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> received his visitors kindly,
but would net allow them to depart until they had helped
him against one of his revolted Sobas, called Kiluanji kia
kwangu by Garcia Mendes.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> Having rendered this service
Dias was dismissed, but the Jesuits remained behind as
hostages. Whilst Dias was absent in Europe, Ngola
defeated an army sent against him, and thus compelled the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
recognition of the Dande river as his boundary, the island
of Luandu alone, with its productive <i>njimbu</i> fishery,
remaining with Kongo. Ngola ndambi died (in 1568?)
before Dias returned.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Second Expedition of Dias, 1574.</span></h4>

<p>After a considerable delay, Dias was sent out as &#8220;Conquistador&#8221;
of the territory recently visited by him. He left
Lisbon on October 23rd, 1574, with seven vessels and
three hundred and fifty men, most of them cobblers,
tailors, and tradesmen.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> Among his officers were Pedro da
Fonseca, his son-in-law, Luis Serr&atilde;o, Andr&eacute; Ferreira Pereira,
and Garcia Mendes Castellobranco, all of whom subsequently
won distinction as &#8220;Conquistadores.&#8221; Three Jesuit
fathers (with P. Balthasar Barreira as superior), and three
Dominicans accompanied him. These latter, however, not
finding the country to their liking, soon sought more
comfortable quarters in Kongo. Dias was authorised to
grant estates (including full seignorial rights) to all such
among his companions as were prepared to build a small
fort at their own expense.</p>

<p>In February, 1575, the fleet sighted the coast near the
Kwanza, and passing over the bar of Kurimba cast anchor
in the fine bay of Luandu, and on February 20th Dias
laid the foundations of a church.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> The island, at that time,
was inhabited by forty Portuguese who had come from
Kongo, and a considerable number of native Christians.
Its cowry fisheries yielded great profit to its owner, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
King of Kongo, who was represented by a governor.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> Not
finding the site originally chosen for his capital to be
suitable, Dias, in 1576, removed to what is now known as
the Morro de S. Miguel, and he named the new colony
&#8220;Reino de Sebaste na conquista de Ethiopia,&#8221; in honour of
the King who fell gloriously at Al Kasr el Kebir, and its
capital S. Paulo de Luandu.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the customary presents were exchanged with
the King, whose name or title seems to have been Ngola a
kiluanji. The King&#8217;s gifts included slaves, cattle, copper
and silver bracelets, and aromatic Kakongo wood. The
Cardinal King D. Henrique (1578-80) converted the silver
bracelets into a chalice, which he presented to the church
of Belem.</p>

<p>Friendly relations continued for three years. The King
had been duly helped against his rebellious sobas; Pedro
da Fonseca lived at the King&#8217;s residence as &#8220;ministro
conservador&#8221; of the Portuguese, and a brisk trade seems
to have sprung up with the new town of S. Paulo de
Luandu, when it was insinuated to the King that the
Portuguese ultimately intended to take possession of his
country, and to sell his subjects abroad as slaves. The
<i>Catalogo</i> traces these insinuations to the jealousy of a
Portuguese trader &#8220;inspired by the Devil,&#8221; and although
neither Garcia Mendes nor Abreu de Brito alludes to this
infamy, their not doing so does not disprove the positive
statement of the <i>Catalogo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> Moreover, whether the King&#8217;s
mind was influenced by envoys from Kongo, or by a
traitorous Portuguese, it must be admitted that the intentions
of the Portuguese were not altogether misrepresented.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>At all events, the results were immediately disastrous, for
twenty Portuguese traders, who were at the King&#8217;s kabasa
at the time, were murdered, together with one thousand
slaves, and their merchandise was confiscated.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Dias in the Field</span>, 1578-89.</h4>

<p>Dias, before this happened, had already (in 1577) built
the fort of S. Cruz,<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> ten leagues up the Kwanza, and was at
the time at a stockade on the Penedo de S. Pedro, still
higher up on the river.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> When there, he was warned not to
advance any further, and, suspecting treachery, he retired
with his one hundred and fifty men to Kanzele (Anzele),<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a>
where he entrenched himself (in 1578). Twenty days later
he received news of the massacre. Dias at once hastened
back to Luandu for reinforcements, the serjeant-major,
Manuel Jo&atilde;o, meanwhile valiantly defending the stockade
and raiding the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>In September, 1580, Dias again left Luandu with three
hundred men. Slowly he proceeded along the Kwanza by
land and in boats, punished the sobas Muchima, Kitangombe,
and Kizua, in Kisama, and defeated the King&#8217;s
army at Makunde,<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> where he had his headquarters for two
years, during which time his subordinates, Jo&atilde;o Serr&atilde;o,
Manuel Jo&atilde;o, and others, established his authority among
the sobas of Kisama and Lamba (Ilamba).</p>

<p>In 1582 he removed to Masanganu, at the &#8220;meeting of
the waters&#8221; of the Lukala and Kwanza. Determined to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
capture the reputed silver mines of Kambambe, he set out
with Luiz Serr&atilde;o, eighty Portuguese, and a &#8220;guerra
preta&#8221; of thirty thousand men. During his forward
march he defeated the soba Mbamba Tungu; and at an
entrenched camp at Teka ndungu, on February 2nd, 1584,
he inflicted a crushing defeat upon the King&#8217;s forces; the
Jesuit Father Balthasar Barreiro claiming no little credit
for having contributed to this victory by his prayers.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> As
a result of this success, many of the sobas declared in
favour of Portugal, but so inconsiderable were the forces
at the command of Dias that he could do no more
than maintain his position at Masanganu. An army under
the Duke of Mbamba, which had been promised to him,
was never sent.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> Reinforcements, however, arrived in
the course of 1584 and 1586,<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> and Dias fought a battle on
the Lukala. But his subordinates did not always meet
with a like success; and Jo&atilde;o Castanhosa Vellez, with one
hundred Portuguese, was completely routed by the soba
Ngola Kalungu.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a></p>

<p>As an incident of the governorship of Paulo Dias may
be mentioned the building of a fort at Benguella velho, by
his nephew, Antonio Lopes Peixoto, in 1587. Unhappily,
fifty men of the garrison ventured abroad, unarmed, and
fell in an ambush; and of the twenty who had remained in
the fort, and who offered a stout resistance, only two
escaped. As a matter of fact, the losses of human life in
these native wars were very considerable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Paulo Dias died in the midst of preparations for a fresh
expedition against Ngola, in October, 1589, and was buried
in the church of N. S. da Victoria, which he himself had
built at Masanganu.<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a></p>

<p>His soldiers elected Luiz Serr&atilde;o, the captain-major, to
succeed him.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Luiz Serr&atilde;o and the Battle of 1590.</span></h4>

<p>Luiz Serr&atilde;o, having completed his preparations, started
with an army numbering one hundred and twenty eight
Portuguese musketeers (with three horses), and fifteen
thousand native allies armed with bows. With this utterly
insufficient force he crossed the Lukala, and then advanced
to the east. On Friday, December 25th, 1590, when at
Ngwalema a kitambu (Anguolome aquitambo) in Ari,<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> he
found himself face to face with the King of Matamba,
whose army had been reinforced by Ngola, the King of
Kongo, the Jaga Kinda,<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> and others. Serr&atilde;o desired to
retire before this overwhelming host, but his subordinate
officers, Andr&eacute; Ferreira Pereira and Francisco de Sequeira,
persuaded him to attack the enemy. He did so, on
Monday, December 28th, 1590, and was defeated. The
retreat was effected in good order. The vanguard of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
forty musketeers was led by Jo&atilde;o de Velloria, then came
the &#8220;guerra preta,&#8221; whilst Serr&atilde;o himself commanded
the rear, and fought almost daily with his pursuers. The
camp at Lukanza, with its valuable contents, had to be
abandoned. At length, on reaching Akimbolo,<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> many
leagues to the rear, the fugitives met Luiz Mendez Rapozo,
who had come up from Luandu with seventy-eight men.
At last they reached the old presidio of Mbamba Tungu
and Masanganu; Manuel Jorge d&#8217;Oliveira was at once sent
down to Luandu for reinforcements, and on their arrival
the siege was raised. L. Serr&atilde;o survived this disaster only
for a month; and when he died, his officers elected Luiz
Ferreira Pereira, the captain-major, to take his place. The
sobas all around, and in Lamba and Ngulungu, headed by
one Muzi Zemba (Muge Asemba), were in the field, but
they were held in check by Pereira, and the Portuguese
name continued to be respected.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Jaga.</span></h4>

<p>Jaga or Jaka is a military title,<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> and by no means the
name of a people. The predatory man-eating bands at
whose head they invaded the agricultural districts towards
the sea coast, included elements of all kinds, not unlike the
bands of the &#8220;Zulu&#8221; of our own time; and hence, one of
the names by which they became known in Angola was
Bangala.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> I have already stated that I do not think that
these military leaders, or Jaga, have anything to do with
the tribe of the Ayaka to the east of Kongo. Still less
can we adopt the monstrous notion that the various
inland tribes who, in the course of the sixteenth century,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
descended upon the coast of the most opposite parts of
Africa, are to be identified with our Jaga. It was Jo&atilde;o
Bermudes<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> who first identified the Galla of Abyssinia with
the Sumba, who raided the coast of Guinea about 1570.
Duarte Lopez (pp. 66, 67) would have us believe that the
Jaga came out of Moenemuge (Mwene muji), and called
themselves Agag.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> But the people of Mwene muji, or the
land of the Maravi, are in reality the Zimbas, who raided
Kilwa and Mombasa in 1589, whilst &#8220;Agag&#8221; looks to me
like a corruption of Agau, which is the name of an
Abyssinian tribe.<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> And hence arises this absurd confusion
of Father Guerreiro, who expects us to believe that the Jaga
are known in Kongo as Iacas, in Angola as Gindes,<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> in
&#8220;India&#8221; (that is, on the East coast of Africa) as Zimbas,
in Prester John&#8217;s country as Gallas, and in Sierra Leone
as Sumbas! Battell, who reports facts and leaves hypotheses
alone, confesses that in his day nothing was known
about the origin of this dreaded people.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a></p>

<p>We have already met with Jaga in Kongo, as allies of
Ngola. In 1590 they were fighting Luiz Serr&atilde;o as the
allies of Matamba, and by 1600 they appear to have
advanced as far as the coast of Benguella, where Battell
joined them, and had an opportunity of gaining an intimate
knowledge of their daily life, not enjoyed by any other
traveller. H. D. de Carvalho<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> and A. R. Neves<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
at the trouble of collecting such information on their
origin as it is possible to gather after the lapse of three
centuries. Entrusting ourselves to the guidance of the
former of these authors, we learn that Kinguri, the son of
the chief of the Bungo, in Lunda, was excluded by his
father from the succession, in favour of his sister Lueji.
Gathering around him his adherents, he left his native
land to found a &#8220;state&#8221; elsewhere. He first settled in
Kioko, then crossed the Upper Kwanza into Kimbundu
(Binbundu of Bi&eacute;), and reached Lubolo, where he made
friends with the chief, Ngongo, whose daughter Kulachinga
he married. He then crossed the Kwanza above Kambambe,
entered into friendly relations with the Portuguese, visited
the Governor, D. Manuel,<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> and offered to fight on the side
of the Portuguese. He was granted land at Lukamba,<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> on
the river Kamueji. Being dissatisfied with this land, on
account of its sterility, he again turned to the eastward,
and, crossing the Lui, finally settled in the country still
occupied by his successors, who (according to Carvalho),
were Kasanje, Ngonga ka mbanda, Kalunga ka kilombo,
Kasanje ka Kulachinga, etc.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> Having settled down,
Kinguri invited his father-in-law to join him, and his
forces were subsequently increased by some discontented
subjects of Queen Nzinga, led by Kalungu. His followers,
being thus a mixture of many tribes, the Jagas were
thenceforth chosen alternately among the three leading
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
families of Kulachinga (Kinguri&#8217;s wife), Ngongo and
Kalunga.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a></p>

<p>It is perfectly clear from this information, collected in
Lunda and Kasanje, that it throws no light upon the
original Jaga, although it may explain the origin of the
Jaga still ruling at Kasanje.</p>

<p>The account given by Ladislaus Magyar<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> evidently
refers to the same leader. According to him, a Jaga
Kanguri settled in the country now occupied by the Sonyo
three hundred years ago. His people were cannibals, but
the more intelligent among them saw that this practice
would ultimately lead to the destruction of the subject
tribes upon whom they depended for support, and they
founded the secret society of the Empacaceiros<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> for the
suppression of cannibalism. Being worsted in a civil war,
they crossed the upper Kwanza into Bi&eacute;, whilst Kanguri
turned to the north-west and settled in Kasanje.</p>

<p>Cavazzi seems to go further back, for he tells us that
Zimbo, who was the first chief of the Jaga (Aiacca), invaded
Kongo, whilst one of his chiefs, &#8220;Dongij&#8221; (Ndongo?),
invaded Matamba, and that the bloody &#8220;kichile,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> or
customs, were introduced by Musasa the wife, and Tembandumba
the daughter, of this &#8220;Dongij.&#8221; The daughter
married Kulambo, whom she poisoned; he was succeeded
by Kinguri, who was killed during an invasion of
Angola, Kulachimbo a great warrior, Kassanje, and many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
others; the last of whom, Kassanje ka nkinguri, was baptised
in 1657.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a></p>

<p>I confess my inability to evolve the truth out of these
conflicting statements, and can only suppose that the title
of &#8220;Jaga&#8221; was assumed by the leaders of predatory hordes
of very diverse origin, in order to inspire terror in the
hearts of peaceful tribes; just, as in more recent times,
certain tribes in East Africa pretend to be Zulu for a like
reason.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">D. Francisco and D. Jeronymo d&#8217;Almeida</span>,
1592-1594.</h4>

<p>The new Governor, D. Francisco d&#8217;Almeida, arrived at
S. Paulo, on June 24th, 1592, accompanied by four hundred
foot-soldiers and fifty African horse, all picked men.
Among the volunteers attending him were his brother,
D. Jeronymo, Luis Lopez de Sequeira and Balthasar
Rebello de Arag&otilde;a;<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> and perhaps also Domingos d&#8217;Abreu
de Brito, who, in a &#8220;Summario e descrip&ccedil;&atilde;o do Reino de
Angola,&#8221; presented to King Philip I, proposed an expedition
across Africa, and the protection of the road to be
opened by a chain of forts.<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a></p>

<p>The new Governor, immediately on his arrival, found
himself face to face with a religious difficulty. The
Jesuits, ever since the days of Dias, expected to be
consulted in all government business. They desired to be
appointed &#8220;preceptors&#8221; (amos) of the native chiefs, their
aim being evidently to create a theocratic government,
such as they established subsequently in Paraguay. They
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
&#8220;used their spiritual influence to induce the conquered
sobas to refuse obedience to the civil powers;&#8221; and when
d&#8217;Almeida made use of the authority conferred upon him
at Madrid in order to crush this &#8220;nascent theocracy,&#8221; he
was excommunicated.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> He certainly was unequal to cope
with these domineering priests. Disheartened, he threw
up a charge to which he felt unequal, and took ship for
Brazil (April 8th, 1593).<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a></p>

<p>D. Jeronymo, at the urgent request of the Camara, took
up the reins of government, and being of a more conciliatory
nature than his brother, made peace with the
Jesuits, and was thus able to take the field. He started
with four hundred men and twenty horses, and received
the submission of the sobas of Kisama, excepting the most
powerful among them. On reaching the salt mines of
Ndemba<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> he founded a &#8220;presidio,&#8221; and garrisoned it with
one hundred men. On his way to the silver-mines of
Kambambe he was struck down with fever, and returned
to Luandu, leaving Balthasar d&#8217;Almeida de Sousa and
Pedro Alvares Rebello in command of the troops. They
were imprudent, and on April 22nd, 1594, fell into an
ambush prepared for them by the powerful chief Kafuche
kabara (Cafuxe cambara). Only the captain-major, thanks
to the swiftness of his horse, and a few men, escaped this
disaster.<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Jo&atilde;o Furtado de Mendon&ccedil;a, 1594-1602.</span></h4>

<p>D. Jeronymo was on the point of hurrying up with
reinforcements when Jo&atilde;o Furtado de Mendon&ccedil;a arrived
at Luandu (August 1st, 1594). He brought with him, not
only four hundred men with thirty horses, but also twelve
European women,<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> the first ever seen in Luandu, in whose
honour the town was decorated.</p>

<p>One of the most memorable events of his governorship
was a campaign which he conducted up the river Mbengu.
Starting at the worst time of the year (in March, 1496), he
quickly lost two hundred men by fever. Having brought
up fresh recruits from Luandu, he avenged himself for a
disaster brought about by his own ignorance, by an
exceptional severity in his treatment of the &#8220;rebels,&#8221;
many of whom were blown from guns. This expedition
kept the field for several years, and proceeded as far as
Ngazi (Ingasia), the chief of which district was called
Ngombe&#8212;the bullock.<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jo&atilde;o de Velloria,<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> the captain-major, had
severely punished the rebellious sobas of Lamba. Masanganu
was once more blockaded by the King Ngola (1597),
until relieved by Balthasar Rebello de Arag&atilde;o. On again
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
descending the Kwanza, he built a presidio in the territory
of the chief Muchima, in Kisama (1559).<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Campaign of 1602-3.</span><a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a></h4>

<p>A new Governor, Jo&atilde;o Rodrigues Coutinho, arrived
early in 1602. He was acceptable to the Jesuits, and soon
won the hearts of the people by his liberality. He had
been authorised by the King to bestow five habits of the
Order of Christ, dub five knights, and appoint thirty
King&#8217;s chamberlains (mo&ccedil;os da camara). Seven years&#8217;
receipts of the export duty on slaves were to be devoted
to the building of forts at the salt mines (Ndemba),
Kambambe, and in Benguela.</p>

<p>Six months after his arrival, the Governor took the field
against the powerful chief Kafuche. His force was the
most formidable that had ever been at the disposal of a
Governor, numbering no less than eight hundred Portuguese.
It was joined at Songo by a portion of the garrison
of Masanganu. Unhappily, the Governor died before
coming in contact with the enemy, and appointed Manuel
Cerveira Pereira as his successor. Battell calls this man
an &#8220;upstart,&#8221; and he certainly had many enemies; but he
is well spoken of by the Jesuits, and was an able soldier.
On August 10th, 1603, he inflicted a crushing defeat upon
Kafuche, at Agoakaiongo,<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> on the very spot where, seven
years before, the Portuguese had met with a great
disaster. Overcoming the stout resistance of the chiefs
of the Museke,<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> he arrived at the head of the navigation
of the Kwanza, and there, at Kambambe, he founded the
Presidio da N.S. do Rozario (1604). Having punished
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
several of the neighbouring chiefs, including Shila mbanza
(Axilambanza), the father-in-law of King Ngola, and left
Jo&atilde;o de Araujo e Azevedo<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> in command of the new
presidio, Pereira returned to the coast.</p>

<p>S. Paulo de Luandu had by that time grown into a fine
town, where commerce flourished. Unfortunately for the
lasting prosperity of the colony, human beings constituted
the most valuable article of export, and the profits yielded
by this slave trade attracted Dutch and French interlopers,
notwithstanding a royal decree of 1605, which excluded
all foreign vessels from the vast territories claimed by
Portugal. In 1607 there were four &#8220;Presidios&#8221; or forts in
the interior, namely Muchima, Agoakaiongo, Masanganu,
and Kambambe.<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">D. Manuel Pereira Forjaz and Bento Banha
Cardoso, 1607-15.</span></h4>

<p>We have already stated that Manuel Cerveira Pereira
had many enemies, and when D. Manuel Pereira Forjaz, the
new Governor, arrived towards the end of 1607, very serious
accusations must have been brought against the former,
for he was at once sent back to Lisbon. There, however,
we are bound to assume that he refuted these accusations,
for otherwise it is not likely that he would have been
re-appointed Governor eight years afterwards: unless, indeed,
he had friends at court who profited by his delinquencies.
Forjaz himself showed to little advantage. He
superseded the commandant of Kambambe by one of his
own creatures, and the fort would certainly have been
taken by the sobas who blockaded it, had not Roque de
S. Miguel and Rebello de Arag&atilde;o hastened to its relief.
Forjaz, moreover, is accused of having imposed an annual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
tax upon the sobas, yielding from twelve to thirteen
thousand cruzados, which seem to have found their way
into his own pockets, and those of his favourites.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> When
he suddenly died in his bed, on April 11th, 1611, the bishop
and the leading men called upon the captain-major,
Bento Banha Cardoso, to take charge of the government.
Cardoso was a man of enterprise, and successful in his
undertakings, but cruel. In 1611 he defeated King
Ngola. The sobas Kilonga and Mbamba Tungu, who fell
into his hands, were beheaded, as were also several of their
makotas. To avenge these executions, fourteen sobas of
Ngola and Matamba made an attack upon Kambambe in
the following year; and although that place was valiantly
defended until relieved, it took a year before order was
restored in the surrounding district. To keep these sobas
in check, a fort (Mbaka) was built on the river Lukala
(1614), eight leagues from Masanganu.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> In Kisama, the
territory of Nambua ngongo (Nabo angungo) was raided
in the same year.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">An Attempt to Cross Africa.</span></h4>

<p>Before proceeding with our account, there remains to be
noticed a serious attempt to cross the whole of Africa
from the west coast to &#8220;Manomotapa,&#8221; on the Zambezi,
which was made by Balthasar Rebello de Arag&atilde;o, by
order of D. Manuel Pereira Forjaz. Rebello de Arag&atilde;o
himself furnishes a very short account of this expedition,<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a>
from which we learn that he discovered copper and iron,
and was told that there was also silver. The natives bred
cattle and cultivated the land, and they told him of a lake,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
in lat. 16&deg; S., giving rise to many rivers, including the
Nile. Unfortunately, when he had advanced one hundred
and forty leagues from the sea, and eighty beyond the
place he started from (Kambambe?), he was summoned
back, as the fort just named was threatened by King
Ngola.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Conquest of Benguella.</span></h4>

<p>In 1615, Manuel Cerveira Pereira<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> returned to the scene
of his former labours, with special instructions to take
possession of Benguella, which for a considerable time
past had been visited by trading vessels. But before he
started upon this enterprise, he ordered his old comrade,
Jo&atilde;o (or Paio?) de Araujo e Azevedo, to deal with Kakulu
Kabasa,<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> Mbumba (Bumba) a ndala, Kilomba kia tubia,
and other revolted chiefs in Angola, whilst he himself
penetrated into the country of the Kakulu Kahenda,<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> who
had given offence by assisting fugitive slaves and interfering
with traders.</p>

<p>Having entrusted Antonio Gon&ccedil;alves Pitta with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
government of S. Paulo, he left that place for the South, on
April 11th, 1617, with four vessels, a patacho, and one
hundred soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> Finding the site of the old fort near
the Terra das duas Puntas unsuitable, he continued his
voyage along the coast, until he came in sight of a
&#8220;sombreiro,&#8221; overlooking the Bahia das Vaccas;<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> and
there he built the fort of S. Filippe de Benguella, which
in course of time developed into a city of some importance.
The sobas of Ndombe, of whose territory he had possessed
himself, naturally objected to the presence of these uninvited
strangers, but they were compelled to submit after five
defeats. The Jaga on the river Murombo likewise gave in,
after three months&#8217; fighting, but soon afterwards broke
the peace, and was executed. The chief Kalunga, at the
mouth of the Koporolo (Kuporol), and the cattle-keeping
Mukimba in the neighbouring hills, also submitted. It
scarcely admits of doubt that Pereira, in the course of his
many military excursions, discovered copper, sulphur and
salt,<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> but he was to benefit little by these discoveries. His
harsh conduct and greed had estranged his people.
Headed by a priest and by their officers, they mutinied,
put their leader on board a patacho, and shipped him off
to S. Paulo, where no notice was taken of his presence, the
Governor being absent at that time, because of a native
war (1618).<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>Pereira once more returned to Madrid, and having
explained matters to the satisfaction of the authorities,
he was sent back, and again reached S. Felippe de Benguella
on August 8th, 1620. He sailed north to Sumba
mbela&#8217;s country, at the mouth of the river Kuvu. A couple
of days inland he discovered more copper, three quintals
of which he took to S. Paulo. He died in the midst of his
labours. The <i>Catalogo</i> credits him with having gone
inland as far as Kakonda.<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Colonial Government.</span></h4>

<p>We have already learned that the native sobas were
handed over to the mercy of individual &#8220;conquistadores,&#8221;
and Rebello de Arag&atilde;o declares that these sobas were
being &#8220;robbed and maltreated.&#8221; They were required by
their masters to pay a tax in slaves, to furnish carriers,
and render all kinds of services,<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> without payment. In
addition to this the Governor, D. M. P. Forjaz, imposed
upon them a poll-tax, which produced from twelve to
thirteen thousand cruzados (say &pound;1,650<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a>) a year. Rebello
de Arag&atilde;o maintains that the native wars were largely due
to this pernicious system, which enriched the Governor and
his officials, whilst traders were made to suffer, and ceased
to visit the &#8220;feiras&#8221; because of the extortionate demands
made upon them. At Mpinda nearly all the &#8220;honest&#8221; trade
had passed into the hands of the Dutch, because of the
monopoly conferred upon Portuguese slave-dealers. He
declares that a tax of 20 per cent. on the salt mined at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Ndemba would pay all the legitimate expenses of government;
but that, although the export duty on slaves yielded
from five to six thousand cruzados, there had not yet been
built a decent house for the government offices.</p>

<p>Garcia Mendes Castellobranco, in a memoir<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> addressed
to the King in 1620, is equally outspoken with regard to
the treatment of the native chiefs, who, he maintains, ought
not to be taxed more heavily than at the time when they
were still subjects of a native king. He, too, refers to the
salt mines as a source of revenue, recommends the levying
of a toll at river crossings, and the expropriation of the
uncultivated territory around S. Paulo.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a></p>

<p>Many of these abuses may, no doubt, be traced to the
demoralising influence of the slave-trade and the insufficient
pay of the officials. A slave costing &pound;3 7<i>s.</i> in the interior
(or nothing, if taken in the course of one of the frequent
slave raids) was sold for more than double that sum on the
coast; and whilst money could be made thus easily the
great natural resources of the country were neglected and
the population&#8212;which, on the arrival of the Portuguese, is
said to have been very considerable&#8212;shrank from year to
year.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a></p>

<p>The export duties on slaves and ivory were farmed out
in 1607 to one Duarte Dias Enriques for twenty million
reis annually (about &pound;6,600).<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a></p>

<p>S. Paulo and Masanganu enjoyed municipal institutions
at that time, but all outside these cities was ruled by
military adventurers. The Governor (in 1607) was paid a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
salary of &pound;267, but the other officials were decidedly
underpaid; and thus, almost of necessity, were driven to
increase their incomes by illegitimate means.<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The War with Ngola nzinga mbandi.</span></h4>

<p>Luiz Mendes de Vasconcellos, the new Governor, arrived
in November, 1617, and almost immediately found himself
involved in a war with the King of Ndongo. Nzinga
mbandi ngola kiluanji,<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> a great tyrant, had been &#8220;removed&#8221;
by his indignant subjects shortly before the arrival of
the new Governor. He left behind him three daughters,
one of whom, born in 1582, became famous as Queen D.
Anna de Souza Nzinga, and two sons, one by a legitimate
wife, the other by a slave woman. It was the latter, Ngola
nzinga mbandi,<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> whom his partisans raised to the throne,
which he reached through rivers of blood, among his
victims being his own brother, a son of his sister, and many
of the trusted councillors of his father. In 1618 the
usurper took the field, intending to expel the Portuguese,
who seem to have given provocation by shifting the old
presidio of Mbaka (Ambaca) to a site much higher up the
Lukala.<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> The Governor, ably supported by his captain-major,
Pedro de Souza Coelho, not only defeated the King,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
but also captured his queen and many other persons of
consideration. The King sued for peace, but as he failed
to surrender the Portuguese whom he had taken prisoner,
the war was renewed in 1619. His allies fared no better
than the King himself. His vice-king of lower Ndongo,
Ngola ari,<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> was compelled to pay a tribute of one hundred
slaves annually (in 1620); and while the Governor raided
the territories of Kahibalongo, Ndonga, and Kasa, his
lieutenant, Lopo Soares La&ccedil;o, destroyed the kilombos of
the sobas Ngunza a ngombe and Bangu.</p>

<p>It had been recognised by this time that many of these
punitive expeditions were provoked by the lawless conduct
of white traders, mulattoes and negros cal&ccedil;ados (that is,
shoe-wearing negroes), who went inland on slaving expeditions;
and only Pumbeiros descal&ccedil;os, that is, native agents
or traders not yet sufficiently civilised to wear shoes, should
be permitted to do so in future.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a></p>

<p>When King Ngola nzinga mbandi heard of the arrival
of Jo&atilde;o Corr&ecirc;a de Souza, the new Governor, in September,
1621,<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> he at once sent his sister to Luandu to arrange
terms of peace. This woman, then about forty years of
age, proved an excellent diplomatist. When the Governor
alluded to the payment of tribute, she declared that
tribute could only be demanded from a conquered people,
and the treaty ultimately signed was one of reciprocity:
fugitive slaves were to be surrendered, and assistance to
be given against common enemies.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Before this able ambassadress left Luandu, she was
received into the bosom of Holy Mother Church, being
baptised as D. Anna de Souza (1622); and on her
return home she persuaded her brother to apply for
the services of a priest, or <i>Mamaganga</i>.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> A priest was
sent, but he was a native, who had been ordained at
Luandu, and one of the King&#8217;s own subjects. The King
looked upon this as an insult; he treated the priest with
great indignity, and once more invaded the Portuguese
territory. Thrice beaten, and deserted by his vassals, he
fled to the island of Ndangi,<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> in the Kwanza river, where
he died of poison administered by his own sister Nzinga,
who thus avenged the murder of her son (1623).</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Queen Nzinga</span>, 1623-1636.</h4>

<p>Nzinga at once renounced Christianity, and the bloody
rites of the Jaga were celebrated when she ascended
her throne. She inaugurated her reign by the murder
of her brother&#8217;s son, of his adherents, and her supposed
enemies. Having reduced her own people to subjection,
with the aid of the Jaga, she declared war upon Portugal.
D. Felippe de Souza Ngola ari, the King of Ndongo
recognised by the Portuguese, was at once ordered to
defend the frontier, and, if possible, to invade the territories
of his kinswoman. On consideration, however, it
was thought best, in the interest of trade, to avoid a
serious conflict. An officer was sent to the court of the
Queen, offering to restore the lost provinces (and thus
sacrificing their vassal D. Felippe), on condition of her
acknowledging herself a vassal, and paying tribute. These
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
conditions were haughtily rejected, and the war began in
earnest.</p>

<p>Jo&atilde;o de Araujo e Azevedo was placed at the head of the
Portuguese invading force.<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> He raided the country along
the Lukala, and then turned back upon the Kwanza,
occupied the islands of Ukole and Kitaka, and came up
with the Queen&#8217;s camp at Ndangi Island. The Queen,
having consulted the spirit of her brother Ngola mbandi,<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a>
declined to risk a battle, and fled into Hako (Oacco). The
Portuguese followed in pursuit, passing through Bemba,
Malemba and Kipupa, and Little Ngangela (Ganguella);
came up with the Queen&#8217;s forces in the territory of soba
Matima (Mathemo), and inflicted a serious defeat upon
them. Among the prisoners taken were the Queen&#8217;s
sisters, Kambe and Funji, and many Makotas. The
pursuit was continued as far as Kina grande in Ngangela,
a deep and difficult gorge, into which some of the soldiers
and the <i>guerra preta</i> descended by means of ropes. When
the Queen fled to the kingdom of Songo, the Portuguese
forces retired to the west (1627).<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a></p>

<p>The two princesses were taken to Luandu, where the
Governor, Fern&atilde;o de Souza, lodged them in his own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
house. In baptism (1628), they received the names of
D. Barbara and D. Engracia.</p>

<p>The Portuguese had no sooner retired than Queen
Nzinga returned to Ndangi Island, and having been
reinforced by several Jaga, she undertook the conquest of
Matamba. At Makaria ka matamba she took prisoner
the dowager-queen<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> Muongo Matamba, and her daughter.
The mother was branded as a slave, and died of grief;
but the daughter was taken into favour, and was baptised
in 1667.</p>

<p>Having thus destroyed the ancient kingdom of Matamba,
the Queen once more invaded Portuguese territory, but
she turned back when she heard that the Jaga Kasanji was
raiding her recent conquest, upon which he claimed to
have prior rights.</p>

<p>At the same time she interfered continually with the
commerce of the Portuguese with the interior; and it was
only in 1636, when the Governor, Francisco de Vasconcellos
da Cunha, sent D. Gaspar Borgia and Father Antonio
Coelho on a mission to the Jaga in Little Ngangela, and
to the Queen at her Kabasa, in Umba, that peaceable
relations were established. The Queen, however, persistently
refused to surrender her claims to the provinces
of Ndongo which had been occupied by the Portuguese.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Minor Events</span>, 1624-1641.</h4>

<p>Punitive expeditions were frequent. In 1624 the Jaga
Kasanji, who had taken advantage of the conflicts between
the Portuguese and Queen Nzinga to rob Pumbeiros, was
severely punished, and Captain Roque de Miguel returned
from this expedition with a large number of captives, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
as a matter of course, were sold into slavery. During the
provisional governorship of the bishop D. Sim&atilde;o de
Mascarenhas<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> (1623-4), Lopo Soares La&ccedil;o meted out
punishment to the Jagas Nzenza a ngombe and Bangu-Bangu,
and to the irrepressible Kafuche.<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> A few years
later, in 1631, the captain-major Antonio Bruto waged a
successful war against rebellious sobas, and more especially
impressed the natives by his victory over the dreaded
Mbuila anduwa (Ambuila Dua), who held out for six
months in a rocky stronghold deemed impregnable. The
invasion of Kongo, in 1622, by order of Governor Jo&atilde;o
Corr&ecirc;a de Souza, who claimed the surrender of Luandu
Island and of all the copper mines, has already been
referred to (see p. 123).</p>

<p>Among the very few measures calculated to promote
the material or moral interests of the colony may be
mentioned the establishment of the three <i>feiras</i>, of Ndondo,
Beja, and Lukamba, in 1625; the foundation of a <i>Santa
casa da misericordia</i> (Poor-house and hospital) at S. Paulo
de Luandu, by the bishop D. Sim&atilde;o de Mascarenhas; the
compulsory cultivation of the banks of Mbengu (Bengo),
when Luandu was threatened with famine owing to the
non-arrival of provision ships from Brazil, in 1629;<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
reform of the administration of the Royal revenue, by
Fern&atilde;o de Souza, in the same year; and the creation of a
board of revenue (<i>Junta da fazenda</i>), charged with the
collection of the tithes and of the tribute payable by the
native chiefs, by Francisco de Vasconcellos da Cunha, in
1638.</p>

<p>The affairs of the missions will be dealt with subsequently,
in a comprehensive manner, but a difficulty which
arose in 1623 between the Governor, Jo&atilde;o Corr&ecirc;a de
Souza, and the Jesuits, may be dealt mentioned at once. In
1619, Gaspar Alvares,<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> a wealthy merchant of Luandu,
placed 20,000 cruzados at the service of the Fathers, in
order that they might found a seminary<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> for the education
of twelve natives. Subsequently he himself became a
member of the Society of Loyola, and devoted the whole
of his fortune, amounting to 400,000 cruzados, to its
purposes. The Governor not unnaturally objected to this
sudden enrichment of a Society which had always been a
thorn in the side of the government. Alvares himself
escaped to S. Salvador, but the Prefect of the Jesuits and
three Fathers were sent as prisoners to Lisbon, where they
were at once liberated; whilst the Governor himself, who
arrived soon afterwards, perhaps with the intention of
justifying his hasty proceedings, was thrown into prison,
and died in the <i>limoeiro</i> in 1626.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Dutch in Angola.</span></h4>

<p>When Philip of Spain seized upon the crown of Portugal
in 1580, that unfortunate country became at once
involved in the troubles between Spain and the United
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Netherlands. No sooner had the destruction of the
<i>Armada</i>, in 1588, enabled the Dutch to take the offensive
on sea, than they began to compete for a share in the
trade of the Portuguese possessions. The Dutch at first
kept on the defensive, but in 1598 they and the Portuguese
came into hostile collision near the Ilha do Principe; and
all efforts to exclude these noxious heretics from sharing
in the trade of the Kongo proved futile, more especially as
the natives themselves preferred their Dutch visitors to
the masterful Portuguese.<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a></p>

<p>An armistice concluded in 1609 expired in 1621. The
Dutch West-India Company was founded in that very
year, and thenceforth the Dutch proceeded aggressively.
In 1623 they burnt several <i>patachos</i> off the mouth of the
Kwanza; in 1629 a Dutch squadron cruised during three
months off the coast of Benguella and captured four Portuguese
merchantmen, but failed to force their way into
the harbour of Luandu. In 1633 two Dutch vessels
menaced S. Felippe de Benguella, but were driven off by
Lopo Soares La&ccedil;o, after a stout fight, on November 15th.
In 1637, Bartholomeu de Vasconcellos da Cunha, the
Governor&#8217;s brother, captured a Dutch man-of-war of 24
guns. At that time the coast was being regularly patrolled
by Portuguese men-of-war,<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> and in 1638 the foundations
of the Fort S. Miguel were laid on the Morro de S. Paulo,
the original site of the city of S. Paulo.</p>

<p>When Portugal recovered her independence, in December,
1640, D. Jo&atilde;o IV of Bragan&ccedil;a at once sent Trist&atilde;o
de Mendoza Furtado to the Hague, with instructions to
demand a suspension of hostilities. The West-India
Company, which profited largely from a state of war,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
declared in favour of a definite treaty of peace, but
objected to the conclusion of an armistice. The Portuguese
envoy had no authority to sign such a treaty; but after
protracted negotiations an armistice for ten years was
signed on June 23rd, 1641, which was to take force outside
Europe as soon as it became known there.</p>

<p>Meantime, the directors of the West-Indian Company
had instructed Count John Moritz of Nassau to take
advantage of the momentary weakness of Portugal, after
her war of liberation, to seize all he could before the terms
of the treaty became known.<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> Count Moritz, being desirous
to increase the supply of slaves for the plantations in
Brazil, determined to seize upon Luandu. A fleet of
twenty-one vessels was at once fitted out at Pernambuco,
and placed under the command of Cornelis Cornelissen
Jol, surnamed Houtebeen, or &#8220;Wooden leg.&#8221; It was
manned by nine hundred sailors, and had on board two
thousand troops, commanded by Jeems Hindersen. This
formidable armament left Pernambuco in June 30th, 1641,
sighted Cabo Negro on August 5th, and having captured
the <i>Jesus Maria</i>, on a voyage from Madeira, was by her
piloted into the harbour of Luandu. On August 24th the
Dutch fleet unexpectedly appeared off S. Paulo, surprising
its inhabitants in the midst of their rejoicings at the
accession of the &#8220;liberator king.&#8221; S. Paulo, at that time,
was a city of twenty thousand inhabitants, including three
thousand Portuguese; but the Governor, Pedro Cezar de
Menezes, though he was at the head of nine hundred
white troops, offered only a feeble resistance; and, accompanied
by many of the citizens, he withdrew to the river
Mbengu, and subsequently to Masanganu. The booty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
which fell into the hands of the Dutch included thirty
ships and ninety-eight cannon.</p>

<p>They lost no time in gaining the goodwill of the neighbouring
sobas, sent an embassy to the King of Kongo (see
p. 125), and entertained offers of alliance from Queen
Nzinga. Aki musanu (Aca mochana) and Nambu a ngongo
(Nabo a ngongo), who had risen upon the Portuguese, were
joined by one hundred and fifty Dutchmen, and thus
enabled to overcome their enemies, whose leaders, Andr&eacute;
da Costa and Jo&atilde;o Vieira, they killed (1642).</p>

<p>In the following year (1643) information was received
that the truce had been signed, but the Dutch director very
naturally declined to surrender the town. He agreed,
however, to suspend hostilities. Pedro Cezar had been
instructed by his government to avail himself of the first
opportunity to recover the city,<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> and it was evidently with
a view to this eventuality that he established a camp on
the river Mbengu. The Dutch suspected his treacherous
design, and at dawn on May 26th, 1643, they surprised his
force. Many Portuguese were killed (including Antonio
Bruto), while Pedro Cezar himself, Bartholomeu de Vasconcellos
da Cunha, and one hundred and eighty seven
soldiers were taken prisoner. The remainder escaped to
Masanganu. The forces assembled there under the captain-major,
Antonio de Miranda, were unable to retrieve this
disaster, but the Governor, aided by friends, managed soon
afterwards to escape.</p>

<p>But though unequal to meeting the Dutch in the field,
the Portuguese were still able to enforce their authority
upon the natives; and in 1645 Diogo Gomes de
Morales led an expedition into Lubolo and Mbalundu
(Bailundo), and reduced the <i>kolombos</i> of thirty &#8220;Jagas&#8221;
to obedience.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1645, the Portuguese of Brazil, under the leadership
of Jo&atilde;o Fernandez Vieira, rose upon their Dutch
oppressors, and in the same year the Dutch occupied
S. Felippe de Benguella. The garrison under Antonio
Teixeira de Mendon&ccedil;a, the captain-major, and Antonio
Gomez de Gouvea, an experienced <i>sertanejo</i>, or backwoodsman,
retired northward along the coast. On reaching
Kikombo Bay, on July 27th, 1645, they met there
Francisco de Sotto-maior, just arrived from Rio de Janeiro
with reinforcements. By advice of Gomez, the troops and
stores were landed in Suto Bay, near Cabo ledo, and conducted
by him in three detachments to Masanganu, without
the Dutch becoming aware of their arrival. The
Governor, Pedro Cezar de Menezes, returned by the same
route to Rio, taking with him a cargo of slaves.</p>

<p>These reinforcements arrived just in time to be employed
against Queen Nzinga. That lady had set a black
and a white cock to fight each other, and the defeat of
the white cock was looked upon by her as a favourable
augury for venturing an attack upon Masanganu. But
Gaspar Borges de Madureira fell upon her before her
forces had been concentrated (January, 1646). She
suffered a severe defeat, notwithstanding the presence of
Dutch auxiliaries. Her sisters once more fell into the
hands of the Portuguese. D. Engracia was strangled soon
afterwards for an act of treachery, whilst D. Barbara was
kept in honourable captivity until 1657.<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Dutch had made preparations for an
advance up the Kwanza. They had built Fort Mols at
the mouth of the river, and another fort higher up.
The Governor, Francisco de Sotto-maior, having died
of fever in May, 1646, measures for a spirited defence
were taken by the three captains-major, Bartholomeu de
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Vasconcellos da Cunha, Antonio Teixeira de Mendon&ccedil;a,
and Jo&atilde;o Juzarte de Andrada. Muchima, which had been
furiously assaulted by the Dutch, was relieved by Diogo
Gomes de Morales. But in the following year the
Portuguese suffered a reverse at Kawala (Caoalla), and
Masanganu itself was threatened by the combined forces
of Queen Nzinga, Kongo, and the Dutch.</p>

<p>However a saviour was at hand in this extremity. On
August 12th, 1648, Salvador Corr&ecirc;a de S&aacute; Benevides,<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> with
nineteen vessels, having on board nine hundred soldiers,
cast anchor in the harbour of Luandu, and summoned the
Dutch to surrender within forty-eight hours. On their
refusal he landed his troops, and after a short bombardment
of Fort S. Miguel, to which the Dutch had withdrawn,
early on August 15th he delivered an assault, which cost
him one hundred and sixty three men, but led to the surrender
of a garrison numbering one thousand one hundred
men, including French and German mercenaries. When
these prisoners had been joined by the three hundred
Dutchmen who were with Queen Nzinga, and the garrison
of Benguella, which surrendered without a blow, they were
shipped off to Europe. The city, in memory of the event,
assumed the name of &#8220;S. Paulo da Assump&ccedil;&atilde;o de
Loanda,&#8221; for it was on the Day of Ascension of the Virgin
Mary that a seven years&#8217; captivity ended. The anniversary
of that event is celebrated to the present day by a religious
procession.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Restoration of Portuguese Authority.</span></h4>

<p>No time was lost in restoring the authority of Portugal
throughout the colony. The King of Kongo was compelled
to accept a treaty by which Luandu Island and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
whole of the country to the south of the Dande river were
unconditionally surrendered, and other advantages held
out (p. 128). Queen Nzinga, although she declined the
overtures of Captain Ruy Pegado<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> for a formal treaty,
retired inland, and gave no trouble for a number of years.
As to the sobas of Lamba, Kisama, Lubolo, and the
Modiku islands, they were visited by punitive expeditions
commanded by Antonio Teixeira de Moraes, Diogo Mendes
de Morales, Vicente Pegado de Pontes, and Francisco de
Aguiar.</p>

<p>Order having been restored, the Governor, Salvador
Corr&ecirc;a de S&aacute;, caused the ruined buildings to be repaired,
and granted crownland to the inhabitants for houses and
gardens. In a very short time prosperity returned, and
the trade of Luandu was as flourishing as ever it had
been.<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a></p>

<p>But although the Portuguese were masters on shore, the
Dutch, and occasionally also French or English &#8220;pirates&#8221;
frequented the coast. In 1650 Alvaro d&#8217;Aguiar defeated
five of these interlopers, who had made prizes of two ships
on a voyage from Brazil; in 1651 Jo&atilde;o Duque was killed in
an action with Dutch men-of-war; in 1652 Jo&atilde;o de Araujo
drove away the Dutch from Mpinda and Luangu; in 1658
the same officer made a prize of a English slaver off
Benguella. A second English slaver was captured in 1659
by Jo&atilde;o Cardoso, who also captured a Dutch vessel off the
Kongo in 1661. In 1662 the definite treaty of peace
between Portugal and Holland was signed, and &#8220;pirates&#8221;
are no longer heard of; although Dutch vessels provided
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
with passes, or favoured by the Governors, seem to have
been admitted to Portuguese ports.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Queen Nzinga and Her Successors.</span></h4>

<p>Queen Nzinga, after the return of her General from a
raid on the territory of Mbuila (Imbuille), in 1655, whence
he brought a miraculous crucifix, felt troubled in her conscience;
and on consulting the spirits of five of her ancestors
(see p. 166), she learned, to her no small terror, that they
were suffering eternal torments, which she could only escape
by once more embracing the Christian faith, and seeking
the friendship of the Portuguese.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> Upon this advice she
acted. The negotiations for a treaty were conducted by
Captain Manuel Freis Peixoto and the Capuchin friar
Antonio of Gaeta, who came to her Court for that purpose
in 1657. Her sister, D. Barbara, was restored to her on
payment of a ransom of two hundred slaves,<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> and the
river Lukala was thenceforth to form the boundary between
the Queen&#8217;s dominions and those of the Portuguese.
No tribute was to be paid by her. Friar Antonio had
the honour of once more baptising this ancient lady, then
seventy-five years of age, and also of marrying her, legitimately,
to a slave-youth, Don Salvatore; while her sister,
D. Barbara, allied herself unto D. Antonio Carrasco
Nzinga a mona, a foster-brother of the Queen, and the
General-in-Chief of her armies. A church, S. Maria de
Matamba, was specially built for these interesting ceremonies.
This remarkable woman died on December 17th,
1663, after Father Cavazzi had administered to her the
last consolations of religion, and was buried in the church
of St. Anna, which had been built within the precincts of
the Royal palace.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>When D. Barbara died, on March 24th, 1666, her husband,
D. Antonio Carrasco Nzinga a mona, killed the
legitimate heir, D. Jo&atilde;o Guterres Ngola kanini, and
usurped the throne, but was himself slain in a battle
against D. Francisco Guterres Ngola kanini, in 1680. The
conqueror then attacked the allies of the Portuguese,
robbed the pumbeiros, and beheaded the Jaga Kasanji
(1682).<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> Luiz Lopez de Sequeira at once took the field
against him with five hundred and thirty infantry,
thirty-seven horse, and ten thousand <i>empacaceiros</i>, and
defeated him at Katole, a place within three days of
the Royal <i>kabasa</i>. The King himself lost his life, but
so did the leader of the Portuguese<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> and Vasco de
Mello da Cunha. Jo&atilde;o Antonio de Brito, who took the
command after his leader&#8217;s death, remained encamped
for thirty days on the site of the battle; and finding
that the enemies did not return, retired to Mbaka;
from which we may judge that the Portuguese, too, suffered
heavy losses. D. Veronica (or Victoria) Guterres, the
sister of the late King, sued for peace, which was readily
granted. Fresh complications threatened in 1689, when
the Queen was charged&#8212;falsely, it appears&#8212;with having
stirred up the soba Kahenda to rebel against his Portuguese
masters; but matters were arranged through the
intervention of bishop D. Jo&atilde;o Franco de Oliveira. No
further trouble seems to have occurred with the successors
of Queen Nzinga until 1744, when the Queen<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> provoked
a war by killing a white trader and robbing pumbeiros:
the result of which was the capture of her capital by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Bartholomeu Duarte de Sequeira, and the cession of the
Kinalunga Islands to Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Last of the Kings of Ndongo, 1671.</span></h4>

<p>We have seen that D. Jo&atilde;o de Souza Ngola ari had
been installed as the first King of Ndongo, recognised
by the Portuguese (see p. 164), about 1627, and had been
succeeded by D. Filippe de Souza, who died in 1660,
and by Jo&atilde;o II. The hope that this tributary would
prove a staunch ally of the Portuguese was not to be
realised, for immediately after the disastrous campaign
against Sonyo (see p. 131), in 1670, D. Jo&atilde;o Ngola ari
raised the standard of rebellion, and invaded the district
of Mbaka. The Governor, Francisco de Tavora,<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> a future
Viceroy of India, who on account of his youth (he was
only 23 years of age) and supposed prudence had been
nick-named <i>o menino prudente</i>, despatched his captain-major,
Luiz Lopes de Sequeira, to reduce the rebel to
obedience. Ngola ari met with a defeat on the river
Luchilu, close to the Pedras of Pungu a ndongo, which
were considered impregnable. Yet, on a dark night, on
November 18th, 1671, Manuel Cortes, the leader of the
<i>guerra preta</i>, surprised this rocky stronghold. The King
himself was taken, and beheaded as a traitor. Thenceforth
there was no further need for punitive expeditions on
a large scale.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Relations with Kongo.</span></h4>

<p>No sooner had the Portuguese regained possession of
S. Paulo than the King of Kongo was called to account
for having sided with the Dutch and favoured the operations
of &#8220;foreign&#8221; Capuchins. A threatened invasion of his
kingdom (1649) speedily led to the conclusion of a treaty
of peace (see p. 126). But as the supposed gold and silver
mines were not ceded, as promised, the Portuguese once
more invaded the country, and in the bloody battle of
Ulanga, in 1666, the King lost his life and crown (p. 129).
From that time to the close of the century anarchy reigned
in Kongo. The disastrous expedition against Sonyo in
1670 (see p. 131) was partly undertaken in order to
support one of the many rival kings of that period.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Minor Punitive Expeditions</span>, 1658-95.</h4>

<p>Jo&atilde;o Fernandes Vieira, who had gained fame as the
leader of the Portuguese patriots in Brazil, where the capture
of Pernambuco had won him the surname of <i>o hero de
nossa edade</i>, arrived as Governor on April 18th, 1658,
and before the close of the year, a serious rebellion broke
out in Upper Ngulungu. The captain-major, Bartholomeu
de Vasconcellos, took the field, and compelled Ngolome a
kayitu (Golome Acaita), to surrender his rocky stronghold
after a siege of four months; Tanga a ngongo submitted
quietly, but Kiluanji kia kanga (Quiloange Acango),
faced the Portuguese four times, and then retired inland
without yielding submission.</p>

<p>A second expedition, in the same year, traversed the
districts to the south of the Kwanza.<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> It started from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Masanganu, and having crossed the Kwanza into Hako
was joined by Ngunza mbambe;<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> it entered the district of
Kabeza, where the Jaga of Rimba brought further reinforcements.
Jaga Ngonga ka anga, the chief of Nsela
(Shella), on the river Kuvu, surrendered his capital, Kangunza,
by the advice of his diviners, without striking a
blow, and submitted to be baptised. The expedition then
returned to Mbaka by way of the river Gango and Tamba;
whilst Cavazzi, who accompanied it as chaplain, took
a more direct road through Kabeza.</p>

<p>After the great victory over the King of Kongo in 1666
(see p. 130), a detachment under Antonio da Silva was sent
into the territory of the Ndembu Mutemu Kingengo, whilst
another, under Diogo Gomes Morales, raided the villages of
Nambua nongo, these chiefs having aided the defeated
King.</p>

<p>Kisama, at all times an unruly district, and even now
virtually independent, though situated on the sea and
within easy reach of Luandu, has repeatedly given trouble
to the Portuguese. In 1672, the sobas of the district
unsuccessfully assaulted the fort at Muchima. In 1686
they blockaded that fort, until relieved by Jo&atilde;o de Figueiredo
e Souza. In 1689, the sobas Kimone kia sanga and
Muchima interfered with the free navigation of the
Kwanza, and were punished by the Portuguese leader
just named; and in 1695, the rebellion of the soba
Katala brought into the field the captain-major, Manuel
de Magalh&atilde;es Leit&atilde;o.</p>

<p>A rebellion in Lubolo, in 1677, was suppressed by
Luiz Lopez de Sequeira. The soba Ngunga mbambe was
killed, and his allies, Sakeda, Ngola kitumba, and Ngola
Kabuku, were severely punished.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Far more serious was an expedition which the Governor,
Gon&ccedil;alo da Costa de Alca&ccedil;ova Carneiro de Menezes,
despatched against the ndembu Mbuilu (Ambuilla), who
had expelled the Portuguese residents, robbed the Pumbeiros,
and burnt the church. Jo&atilde;o de Figueireda e Souza,
a trusted officer, was given the command; and notwithstanding
that the garrison of Masanganu mutinied and
refused to join him, he mustered, on May 25th, 1682, a
formidable force of six hundred musketeers, forty-two
horse, and a <i>guerra preta</i> of forty thousand men, with two
field guns. Unfortunately, he lost precious time by
lingering two months at Kamolembe, where many of his
people died; and when at last ready to start, he heard
that Mbuila had been reinforced by two &#8220;armies&#8221; sent to
his aid by King Manuel of Kongo<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> and Queen Nzinga,
and lost his head. Fortunately for the Portuguese a
stroke of paralysis carried off this pusillanimous leader,
and his place was taken by Pascoal Rodrigues, a man of
much energy, who marched straight upon the mbanza of
Mbuilu, and there achieved a great victory. Mbuilu fled
to his neighbour and ally Ndamba (Dambe). The number
of prisoners taken was so great that it was feared they
might endanger the safety of their captors, and they
were mercilessly beheaded, a nephew of Mbuilu alone
being sent a prisoner to Luandu.<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a></p>

<p>When Pascaol Rodrigues fell ill, the Governor appointed
Jo&atilde;o Baptista de Maia to succeed him. The troops passed
the rainy season in barracks. On the return of fine weather,
Mbuilu was pursued into the territory of Ndamba and
killed. The mbanzas and over one hundred and fifty
libatas were burnt. The Ndembu Kabanda, a partisan of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Mbuilu, was pursued by the sergeant-major, Louren&ccedil;o de
Barros Morim, and the leader of the <i>guerra preta</i>, Gon&ccedil;alo
Borges de Barros, and killed with many of his people.
Another ndembu having been installed, and sworn
allegiance to the King of Portugal, the army returned to
Mbaka, and thence to Lembo near Masanganu. The
victorious troops were refused admission into the latter,
the garrison of which had mutinied. It was only after the
Governor had promised a pardon to the offenders, with the
exception of the leaders, that order was restored (1693).</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Benguella.</span></h4>

<p>S. Filippe de Benguella was founded in 1617 by Manuel
Cerveira Pereira, and in 1661 its fortifications were rebuilt
by Gaspar de Almeida Silva, whilst Manuel de Tovar
Froes fought the neighbouring sobas. A further step in
advance was taken in 1682, when the sergeant-major,
Pedro da Silva, founded the presidio of Kakonda a velha,
in the territory of the soba Bongo. Two years later, in
1684, this presidio was surprised by Bongo, and Manuel da
Rocha Soares, its commandant, was killed. Carlos de
Lacerda, who was despatched to avenge this outrage, being
compelled to fall back before superior forces, Jo&atilde;o Br&aacute;z de
Goes, the captain-major of Benguella, himself took the field.
The Jaga, deserted by his people, sought refuge with
Ngola njimbu (Golla Gimbo), but was pursued and captured,<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a>
and the present presidio was built eighty miles further
inland (1685), in the territory of the soba Kitata. An
attempt made by the soba of Huambo (Hiamba), in 1698,
to expel the Portuguese was frustrated by Antonio de Faria,
its commandant. A more formidable attack by the neighbouring
sobas, in 1718, proved equally ineffectual. The
Portuguese had thus gained an advanced post nearly one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
hundred and fifty miles from the coast, the possession of
which opened up to them fresh sources for the supply of
slaves, and contributed not a little to the growing prosperity
of S. Filippe de Benguella.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ecclesiastical Affairs.</span></h4>

<p>The Jesuits were the earliest missionaries in Angola; but
it would be in vain to look to them for any precise geographical
or historical information, such as is furnished by
members of the Society established in other parts of the
world. They confined their activity to the seat of Government
and its immediate vicinity, and Portuguese authors
are severe upon their love of power and covetousness.
Their relations with the Governors were on many occasions
strained, but it cannot be asserted that the Jesuit Fathers
were in every instance in the wrong.<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> As an illustration of
their masterfulness, the following incident may serve. In
1661, the Governor, Jo&atilde;o Fernandez Vieira, very properly
ordered that pigs, should no longer be allowed to run about
the streets of the capital. The Jesuits did not deign to
take the slightest notice of this order; and when several of
their slaves were arrested for disregarding it, they protested
against this exercise of authority, and actually excommunicated
the Governor. But the Governor was not
to be frightened. He reported the case to his King, D.
Affonso VI, and the King in a Royal rescript of December
9th, 1666, severely reproved the Jesuits for their insolence;
and threatened, in case of similar conduct, to deprive them
of the crown lands, and to take other legal measures
against them.</p>

<p>Franciscans (Tertiaries of the Order of St. Joseph)
followed the Jesuits in 1604. Then came the Capuchins,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
for the most part Italians and Castilians, in 1651; and
lastly barefooted Carmelites (Religiozos de S. Thereza).
Of all these friars the Italian Capuchins alone appear to
have done good work; and to members of their Order, and
especially to Giovanni Antonio Cavazzi, of Montecuccoli,
Antonio Laudati, of Gaeta, and Antonio Zucchelli, of
Gradisco, we are indebted for much useful information
regarding the people among whom they laboured. Many
of the other friars seem to have been men whom their
superiors in Europe were glad to part with; and the same
may be said with reference to the secular clergy.</p>

<p>A report of the ecclesiastical affairs of Angola and Kongo,
drawn up in 1694 by Gon&ccedil;alo de Alca&ccedil;ova Carneiro
Carvalho da Costa de Menezes, by order of the Governor,
presents us with a deplorable picture of the state of affairs
in that year. Throughout the country there were only
thirty-six friars<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> and twenty-nine secular clergy; and of
these as many as twenty-nine had taken up their quarters
in the capital. Of fifty churches and chapels, many were
without priests, and had fallen into ruins. The village
missions (miss&otilde;es das Sanzalas) had long been given up,
and many baptised negroes had returned to the ancient
superstitions. The author proposes the institution of a
court of clerics, in order that all lapses of this kind might
be punished in accordance with the &#8220;sacred canons.&#8221; A
board of missions (Junta das miss&otilde;es), which had been
created in 1693, and richly endowed,<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> allowed things to
drift. Lopes de Lima<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> ascribes the failure of the Christian
missions, first, to the small number of missionaries
and priests; secondly, to the corruption of the clergy;
and thirdly, to the slave-trade.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Measures of Administration.</span></h4>

<p>Jo&atilde;o Fernandez Vieira must be credited with the first
serious attempt to organise the military forces of the
country (1660), by raising a regiment, or <i>ter&ccedil;o</i>, of infantry,
for Luandu, and a company for each presidio. These
&#8220;regulars&#8221; were to be supported by the <i>guerra preta</i>, or
<i>empacaceiros</i>. A company of cavalry was added to the
regular troops in 1672; and the exemption from every
kind of military service conferred upon the inhabitants of
Luandu since 1660 was partly abolished in 1695, and
orders given for the organisation of a <i>ter&ccedil;o</i> of <i>ordenan&ccedil;as</i>
(militia) for Luandu, and of seventeen companies for the
districts and presidios. The fortifications of Luandu had
been much improved since the expulsion of the Dutch.
The fort of S. Miguel, at Luandu, which was begun in
1638, had been completed by D. Jo&atilde;o de Lencastre in
1689; and at the close of the century there existed forts,
sufficiently strong to resist native attack, at Muchima,
Masanganu, Kambambe, Pungu a ndonga, Mbaka, S.
Filippe de Benguella, and Kakonda.</p>

<p>The only measure bearing upon the civil administration
of the country seems to have been the publication of a
<i>Regimento</i> for the guidance of officers of revenue and of
justice, in 1675. At the same time, an extra export-duty
of ten test&otilde;es<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> was ordered to be paid on every slave, the
proceeds to go towards the dowry of Queen Catherine, the
consort of Charles II of England.</p>

<p>The introduction of copper coins (<i>makutas</i>) into Luandu,
in 1624, caused much dissatisfaction, and actually led to
a mutiny of the troops, who not unnaturally felt agrieved at
being expected to accept 200 reis in copper as an equivalent
of a native cloth, up to that time valued at 700
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
reis.<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> The mutiny was suppressed, and the five ringleaders
were executed. In the interior of the country, the ancient
currency remained in force, larger amounts being paid in
merchandise (<i>fazenda de lei</i>), whilst smaller sums were
paid in <i>zimbos</i> (njimbu) or cowries, <i>libongos</i> (mbongo,
plural jimbongo), or square pieces of native cloth, or blocks
of rock-salt.</p>

<p>The only attempt at geographical exploration was that
of Jos&eacute; de Roza, who left Masanganu in 1678, for the
lower Zambezi, but turned back after only a few days&#8217;
journey, owing to the hostility of the natives.</p>

<p class="tb">At the end of the seventeenth century, Portugal held
sway over a territory of over fifty thousand square miles;
she maintained fortified posts far inland; her traders had
penetrated as far as the upper Kwanza; and on the coast
she held the prosperous cities of S. Paulo de Luandu and
S. Filippe de Benguella. But this prosperity depended
almost exclusively upon the slave trade. Scarcely any
attempt had been made to develop the great natural
resources of the country, and even the food of the inhabitants
was still largely supplied by the Brazils. The colonists
introduced included too large a criminal element; the
Government officials were more intent upon realising large
fortunes<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> than permanently benefiting the country they had
been sent to rule; and even among the preachers of the
gospel were men quite unfit to hold the office which they
filled. And this deplorable state of affairs continued long
beyond the period with which we have dealt. Lopes de
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Lima<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> calls D. Francisco Innocencio de Sousa Coutinho, who
was appointed in 1764, the &#8220;first Governor who undertook
to civilise this semi-barbarous colony; and who during his
rule of eight years and a-half, did more in that sense than
all his predecessors had ever thought of.&#8221; Up to his time,
&#8220;Governors, captains, magistrates, men of the church and
the cloister&#8221; were only intent upon dividing the spoils
of office, and acted in the most scandalous manner.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">1</span></a> Battell tells us (p. 7) that he and Thomas Turner were transported
to Angola in the same vessel (1590). Purchas conferred with Turner
after he had returned to England, and obtained from him an account
of his travels, he having &#8220;lived the best part of two years in Brazil&#8221;
(<i>lib.</i> vi, c. 8). Elsewhere we learn that he &#8220;had also been in Angola&#8221;
(see p. 71).
</p><p>
This apparently straightforward information is quite irreconcilable
with what we are told by Knivet; for Knivet says he met Turner at
Pernambuco (about 1598); that he advised him to go to Angola; that
Turner acted on this advice, and &#8220;made great profit of his merchandise,
for which he thanked me when we met in England.&#8221; Concerning

1472, and received its first settlers in 1486. In the course of the
sixteenth century it suffered much from the depredations of French,
English, and Dutch pirates, as also (1574) from a revolt headed by the
Angolares: that is, the descendants of Angolan slaves who had swum
ashore when the vessel which carried them was wrecked, in 1544, on
the Sette Pedras, and had fled to the woods near. The Fortaleza de
S. Sebasti&atilde;o was intended to defend the capital against piratical
attacks. It was completed in 1575; but the Dutch, under Admiral
Van der Dam, nevertheless sacked the city in 1600. Only four years
before the author&#8217;s arrival, in 1485, the city had been destroyed by fire.</p></div>

are no springs. The chief articles of export are cacao and coffee.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28"><span class="label">28</span></a> This capture must have happened at the end of 1589, or, at latest,
early in 1590, yet Thomas Knivet, who only left England with Cavendish
in August 1591, gives an account of the capture of five Englishmen
(Purchas iv, 1625, p. 1220) which at the first glance seems to be a
different version of this very incident. Knivet professes to have been
at Rio de Janeiro at the time, two months after his return from Angola
in 1598. He says: &#8220;There came a small man-of-war to Great Island
[Ilha Grande, 70 miles west of Rio]; the captain&#8217;s name was <i>Abram
Cocke</i>; he lay in wait for the ships on the River of Plate, and had
taken them if it had not been for five of his men that ran away with
his boat that discovered his being there; for within a sevennight after
he was gone three caravels came within the same road where he was.
These five men were taken by a Friar who came from S. Vincent,
and were brought to the river of Janeiro. I being at this time in
some account with the Governor favoured them as well as I could.&#8221;
In the further course of his narrative Knivet names two of these five
men, namely, <i>Richard Heixt</i> and <i>Thomas Cooper</i>. <i>Thomas Turner</i>
is referred to elsewhere, but not under circumstances which would
lead one to assume that he was one of the five. Battell is not
mentioned at all.
</p><p>
Are we to suppose, then, that Captain Cocke <i>was</i> heard of once more,
and that in 1599 he lost five men on the Ilha Grande, just as nine
years before he had lost five on the island of San Sebastian? Such a
coincidence is possible, but most improbable.</p></div>

worth 1000 reis! Duarte Lopez (<i>Kingdom of Congo</i>, London, 1881,
p. 46) says that one such tail was equal in value to two or three slaves,
and that native hunters followed the elephants up narrow and steep
defiles, and there cut off the desired spoils. Battell himself (see p. 58)
bought 20,000 (hairs) which he sold to the Portugals for thirty slaves.</p></div>

in Portugal in the beginning of the sixteenth century. A
Royal order of 1526 ordered them to leave the kingdom, but appears
to have had no more effect than a law of 1538, which, on account of
the thefts of which they were accused, and their sorceries, threatened
them with a flogging and the confiscation of their goods, if caught
within the kingdom. This law was re-enacted in 1557, when the
galleys were substituted for a flogging; and in 1592 a still more severe
law was enacted, which threatened with death all those who should not
quit the kingdom within four months. Battel&#8217;s associates were, no
doubt, gipsies who had been sent as convicts to Angola (see F. A.
Coelho, <i>Os Ciganos de Portugal</i>, Lisbon, 1892).

The Moriscoes are the Moors of Morocco. Early Portuguese

ground. The player beats this board with his two index fingers.
A. R. Neves, <i>Mem. da Epedi&ccedil;&atilde;o a Cassange</i>, p. 110, calls <i>tabalha</i> a

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_73" id="Footnote_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73"><span class="label">73</span></a> The baobab is indifferently called by Battell <i>alicunde</i>, <i>licondo</i>,
<i>elicondi</i>, <i>olicandi</i>, or <i>alicunde</i>, all of which are corruptions of <i>nkondo</i>,
by which name the tree is known in Congo. The Portuguese know
this characteristic tree of the coast-land and the interior as <i>imbondeiro</i>
(from <i>mbondo</i> in Kimbundu). Its inner bark yields a fibre known as
<i>licomte</i>, is made into coarse cloth, and is also exported to Europe to
be converted into paper. The wood is very light. The pulp of the
fruit is refreshing, and was formerly esteemed as a remedy against
fever and dysentery. The seeds are eaten. The shell (<i>macua</i>) is
used to hold water (hence the popular name of Calabash tree).
Ficalho distinguishes three species, viz., <i>Adansonia digitata</i>, Linn.,
the fruit of which is longish; <i>A. subglobosa</i>, bearing a bell-shaped
fruit; <i>A. lageniformis</i>, yielding a fruit shaped like a cucumber (see

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_76" id="Footnote_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76"><span class="label">76</span></a> The so-called fetishes (from <i>feiti&ccedil;o</i>, a Portuguese word meaning
sorcery) are not idols, but charms and amulets, generally known as
<i>nkissi</i>, <i>nkishi</i>, or <i>mukishi</i>. There are <i>nkissi</i> peculiar to a district,
village, or family; charms and amulets to shield the wearer or possessor
against all the evils flesh is heir to, and others enabling the priest or
<i>nganga</i> to discover crime or the cause of disease. The idea underlying
the belief in the efficacy of these charms was very prevalent
among our own ancestors, and the images, rosaries, crosses, relics,
and other articles introduced by the Roman missionaries are looked
upon by the natives as equivalent to their own <i>nkissi</i>. Even at the
present day, images of S. Francis and of other saints may be seen in
the collection of Royal Fetishes at S. Salvador, and a cross called
<i>santu</i> (Santa Cruz) &#8220;is the common fetish which confers skill in hunting&#8221;
(Bentley, <i>Pioneering on the Congo</i>, vol. i, pp. 35, 36, 39). The
images, according to Bentley, seen among the natives are not idols
but receptacles of &#8220;charms&#8221; or medicine. As to a belief in witchcraft
(<i>ndoki</i>, witch; <i>Kindoki</i>, witchcraft), it is not even now quite
extinct among Christian people, boasting of their civilisation, for
a reputed wizard was drowned at Hedingham in Essex in 1863,
and a witch burnt in Mexico as recently as 1873. Matthew Hopkins,
the famous witch-finder, cannot claim a higher rank than an African
<i>nganga</i>, although his procedure was not quite the same. Nor can I
see any difference between a fetish and the miraculous &#8220;bambino&#8221;
manufactured in the sixteenth century, and kept in the church of
S. Maria Arac&oelig;li, which a priest takes to the bedside of sick or
dying persons, who are asked to kiss it to be cured, and whose
guardians are at all times ready to receive the offerings of the faithful
(see Dickens, <i>Pictures from Italy</i>).</p></div>

<i>mfumu</i>, chief) or king is selected by the Mamboma (see p. 59) and
the princes, and must be a nephew (sister&#8217;s son) of his predecessor.
On his election he takes the title of <i>Nganga nvumbu</i> (<i>Nganga</i>, priest;
<i>nvumbu</i>, benevolent spirit, breath), but only proceeds to that of
Maloango when rich enough to summon the whole country to a great
feast, when declaration is made for the first time officially of the death
of the former Maloango, and he is buried. As these festivities are
very expensive, they are often deferred for years, and many a <i>Nganga
nvumbu</i> has died without even troubling about the higher title. The
successors of the Maloango Njimbi of Loango, of Battell&#8217;s time,
according to Mr. Dennett, have been: 1. Maloango Tati of Kondi;
2. Mani Puati of Chibanga; 3. Mani Yambi; 4. Man&#8217;anombo; 5. Mani
Makosso Matukila of Kondi; 6. Mani Makosso Manombo; 7. Mani
Makosso Masonga; 8. Mani Puati. Nos. 3 to 8 never assumed the
title of Maloango. Mani Puati very much disgusted the people with
his cruelty (he had killed his own daughter because she refused to
cohabit with him); and when the French, in 1898, called upon the
Mamboma and the princes to produce a Maloango, they ignored the
existence of Puati, and elected his nephew, Mani Luemba. This list,
however, is evidently imperfect.</p></div>

(Boio, the underground <i>nkishni</i>), <i>ke zinga</i> (not live long)!
</p><p>
Freely translated, it would mean &#8220;My companion, the white face,
has risen from underground, and will not live long.&#8221; This is a curious
greeting, but it fairly represents native ideas: for the white man, as
long as he keeps to his ship (supposed to rise from the bottom of the
ocean), is believed to live long; whilst, once he comes to stay ashore,
he is condemned to an early death.</p></div>

borne, according to Dapper, p. 522, by the king&#8217;s &#8220;mother.&#8221; <i>Nkondi</i>,

wooden bell (<i>ndibu</i>) round the neck, the clatter of which scares the
game. When the scent grows warm, the dogs begin to whine, and
when the game is in sight they give tongue. After each beat the dogs
sit down apart from the hunters, raise their heads, and howl for several

<i>Loango Exp.</i>, vol. iii, p. 188). <i>Nkasa</i>, prepared from the bark of
<i>Erythrophlaeum guineense</i>, paralyses the action of the heart, but if
thrown up at once, it will not kill (Dr. M. Boehr, <i>Correspon. der
Deutschen Afrik. Ges.</i>, vol. i, p. 332). It is administered to persons
who deny being witches. (For a full account of such a trial, see
Dennett, <i>Seven Years Among the Fjort</i>, p. 165.) In the case of minor
offences, the ordeal of the hot matchet&#8212;<i>bikalo</i>, <i>bisengo</i>, or <i>bau</i>&#8212;is
resorted to. The knife is passed thrice over the skin of the leg, and
if it burns the accused is declared guilty (see also Dennett, <i>Notes on
the Folk-Lore of the Fjort</i>, p. 162). The Nganga is, of course, open to
a bribe, and in the case of a chief the poison may be administered to
a substitute&#8212;a dog or a slave&#8212;and the penalty commuted to a fine.

1620 when Garcia Mendez de Castellobranco proposed to King
Philip a &#8220;regimen de aforamento&#8221; of the native chiefs, which would
have yielded a revenue of fifteen million Reis, and would, at the same

Portugal). He says that the natives will not suffer this
fish to be injured, as it drives other fish ashore and into their nets;
and that if one of these fish were to be wounded or killed they would
stop away for ever so long. The Rev. W. M. Holman Bentley, in his
<i>Dictionary of the Kongo Language</i>, says that the <i>ngola</i> of the natives
is a bagre, or catfish. A gigantic bagre, 8 ft. in length, is found in
the Upper Coanza (Monteiro, <i>Angola</i>, vol. ii, p. 134). Mr. Dennett
suggests the <i>Chialambu</i>, a kind of bream, which is said to chase other
fish; <i>Mboa</i>, <i>Mbwa</i>, or <i>Imboa</i> certainly means dog, and is not the

the &#8220;great&#8221; Zaire (<i>nzari anene</i>). On the other hand, D. Pedro

Sonyo to be a corruption, at the mouths of natives, of San Antonio.
This is quite possible, for when the old chief was baptised, in 1491, he
received the name of Manuel (after the King), whilst his son was
thenceforth known as Don Antonio. Images of Sa. Manuela and
S. Antonio are still in existence, and are venerated by the natives as
powerful fetishes (Bastian, <i>Loangok&uuml;ste</i>, vol. i, p. 286). Soyo, according
to the same author, is the name of a district near the Cabo do
Padr&atilde;o. Yet Garcia de Resende and Ruy de Pina, in their Chronicles
of King Jo&atilde;o II, only know a Mani Sonho, whom Jo&atilde;o de Barros

in letters written between February 15th, 1539, and December 4th,
1540, the King refers to D. Manuel, who was about to go to Rome, as

the Virgin for the white cross seen during the battle. Cavazzi (p. 273),
and others, down to Father Eucher (<i>Le Congo</i>, Huy, 1894, p. 36), unhesitatingly
accept this miracle. The Rev. W. H. Bentley most
irreverently suggests a solar halo; but such a phenomenon might
account for flaming swords, but not for the Virgin and St. James.</p></div>

sacraments. In 1653, the parochial priests complained that the Capuchin
friars administered the sacraments without claiming an &#8220;acknowledgment;&#8221;
and the authorities at Rome (1653) prohibited their doing
so within five leagues of the capital (Paiva Manso, p. 233). At Mbamba,
the priest had a regular scale of prices. A baptism cost 7,000 cowries,
for a marriage a slave was expected, and so forth; and thus, adds the
Bishop of Angola (1722): &#8220;little children go to limbo, and grown-up
people to hell!&#8221;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_394" id="Footnote_394"></a><a href="#FNanchor_394"><span class="label">394</span></a> Lopes de Lima (<i>Ensaio</i>, vol. iii, <i>parte segundo</i>), is very severe
upon Cavazzi, whom he charges with having &#8220;falsified&#8221; history, but
does nothing himself to throw light upon the vexed question of the
names of the kings of Matamba and Ndongo. The following is a
summary of Cavazzi&#8217;s very copious information (where Antonio of
Gaeta gives different names, these are added within brackets). <i>Ngola</i>,
the smith, or <i>musuri</i> (<i>Ngola Bumbumbula</i>), was the founder of the
kingdom of Ndongo. Having no sons, he was succeeded by his
daughter, <i>Nzunda ria ngola</i>, and then by another daughter, <i>Tumba ria
ngola</i>, who married a <i>Ngola kiluanji kia Samba</i>, a great warrior.
Their son, <i>Ngola kiluanji</i>, was succeeded by <i>Ndambi ngola</i>. Then
followed <i>Ngola kiluanji kia ndambi</i>, another great warrior, who
advanced to within ten leagues of the sea, and planted a <i>nzanda</i> tree
(<i>Insandeira</i>), on the northern bank of the Kwanza, a short distance
above Tombo, to mark the furthest point reached by his conquering
hosts. <i>Nzinga ngola kilombo kia kasende</i> (<i>Ngola kiluanji</i>) followed
next; then came <i>Mbandi ngola kiluanji</i>, the father, and <i>Ngola mbandi</i>,
the brother, of the famous Queen <i>Nzinga (Jinga) mbandi ngola</i> (born
1582, acceded 1627, died 1663), since whose day the upper part of
Ndongo, including Matamba; has been known as Nzinga or Ginga.
The great queen was succeeded by her sister, <i>D. Barbara da Silva</i>,
who married <i>D. Antonio Carrasco nzinga a mina</i> (she died 1666).
Then followed in succession <i>D. Jo&atilde;o Guterres Ngola kanini</i>, <i>D.
Francisco Guterres Ngola kanini</i> (1680-81), and <i>D. Victoria</i>, whom
Cadornega calls <i>Veronica</i>.
</p><p>
According to Lopez de Lima, it was a Jaga of Matamba, <i>Ngola a
nzinga</i>, who conquered Ndongo, and gave it as an appanage to his
son, <i>Ngola mbandi</i>. It was this <i>Ngola mbandi</i> who invited the
Portuguese in 1556, and a son of his, bearing the same name or title,
who received Dias in 1560.
</p><p>
Cadornega (Paiva Manso, p. 281) gives the following names as the
&#8220;Kings of Angola&#8221; since the arrival of the Portuguese: Ngola
a kiluanji, Ngola mbandi, Ngola a kiluanji II, Queen Nzinga D. Anna
de Sousa, D. Antonio Carrasco Nzinga a mina, D. Barbara da Silva,
his wife; D. Jo&atilde;o Guterres Ngola kanini, D. Luis, D. Francisco
Guterres Ngola kanini, D. Veronica, the wife of D. Francisco.</p></div>

beyond the later capital, Pungu a ndongo, perhaps as far as the
Anguolome aquitambo (Ngwalema a kitambu) of Garcia Mendes, in the
district known as Ari. Another Angolome (Ngolome) lived less than
twenty leagues from the coast, on the northern side of the Kwanza,

gross over-estimate in calculating his further progress, and assuming
him to have gone to the south-east, which was not only the shortest
route to Chikovo and Mwanamtapa, but also avoided the country
of the hostile Ngola, he cannot even have got as far as Bi&eacute;. As to
a &#8220;big lake,&#8221; he heard no more than other travellers have heard since,
only to be disappointed. The natives certainly never told him that
one of the rivers flowing out of that lake was the Nile. This bit of
information he got out of a map. His expedition <i>may</i> have taken

the instructions, which were only carried out in 1612, when Kambambe
was in reality threatened by the natives.</p></div>

Kasanji, of modern maps. Kina (quina) simply means &#8220;sepulture&#8221; or

arriving in the country where subsequently he settled permanently,
took up his quarters at Kina kia kilamba (&#8220;Sepulture of the exorcist&#8221;).

<i>Monti Freddi</i> (&#8220;cold mountains&#8221;) of the text, stated to be known to the
Portuguese as <i>Monti nivosi</i> (&#8220;snowy mountains&#8221;). Modern maps show a
<i>Serra da neve</i> in 14.0 S.; but as I am not aware that snow ever fell in
these mountains, <i>neve</i> may be an ancient misprint for <i>nevoas</i> (mists).
The <i>Serra Fria</i> may possibly be connected with the <i>Cabo Frio</i>, thus
named because of the cold current which washes it.</li>

There are numerous villages called Mpangu, several of which are indicated upon our map, but the Mbanza of Mpangu, according to Lopez, was near the river Barbela, which is another name for the Kongo. <i>See also</i> Mpanzu alumbu, <a href="#Page_115">115</a>, <a href="#Page_116">116</a>.</li>
<li>
<b>Mpanzu-alumbu</b> (Panzu or Pazoalumbu) a village or district on the lower Kongo, either in Mpangu-lungu or that district itself. King Affonso (Paiva Manso, 50) calls himself &#8220;Lord of the Conquest of Pazoallumbo,&#8221; and does not mention Pangalungu, which certainly was a district incorporated with Kongo in his day. Bastian (<i>Exped. an der Loangok&uuml;ste</i>, i, 289), mentions a village Mpanzo, and another Mpanzo mfinda (&#8220;Mpanzo in the Wood&#8221;) as being near Sonyo.
